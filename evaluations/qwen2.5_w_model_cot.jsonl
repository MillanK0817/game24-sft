{"puzzle": "2 3 8 12", "response": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 2, 3, 8, and 12 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the numbers\nWe have the numbers 2, 3, 8, and 12. We need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, / to reach 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for combinations involving multiplication or division\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, it\u2019s likely that multiplication or division will be involved. Let\u2019s explore possibilities:\n\n1. **Using 12 and 2:**\n   - \\( 12 * 2 = 24 \\)\n   - Now we need to incorporate 3 and 8 into this equation without changing the result. However, adding or subtracting 3 and 8 would alter the result, so this approach doesn\u2019t work.\n\n2. **Using 8 and 3:**\n   - \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)\n   - Similarly, this approach also doesn\u2019t work because we still need to incorporate 12 and 2.\n\n3. **Combining 12, 8, and 2:**\n   - \\( 12 - 8 = 4 \\)\n   - Now we have 4, 3, and 2 left. We can try \\( 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 \\), but this uses the number 3 twice, which violates the rules.\n\n4. **Combining 12, 3, and 2:**\n   - \\( 12 / 3 = 4 \\)\n   - Now we have 4, 8, and 2 left. We can try \\( 4 * 8 * 2 = 128 \\), which is too large.\n\n5. **Combining 8, 3, and 2:**\n   - \\( 8 / 3 \\approx 2.6667 \\)\n   - Now we have 2.6667, 12, and 2 left. Multiplying these together gives approximately \\( 2.6667 * 12 * 2 = 56 \\), which is too large.\n\n### Step 3: Try different groupings\nLet\u2019s try grouping the numbers differently:\n\n1. **Group 12 and 8 first:**\n   - \\( 12 - 8 = 4 \\)\n   - Now we have 4, 3, and 2 left. We can try \\( 4 * 3 * 2 = 24 \\). This works!\n\n### Step 4: Verify the solution\nLet\u2019s verify the equation:\n\\[\n(12 - 8) * 3 * 2 = 4 * 3 * 2 = 24\n\\]\nThis equation uses all four numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 - 8) * 3 * 2}"}

Let's explore different ways to combine them using the allowed operations.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining 13 and 13\nFirst, consider the two 13s:\n- \\(13 + 13 = 26\\)\n- \\(13 - 13 = 0\\)\n- \\(13 * 13 = 169\\)\n- \\(13 / 13 = 1\\)\n\nNone of these results seem immediately helpful, so let's try combining one 13 with another number.\n\n### Step 3: Combine 13 and 2\nNext, consider combining 13 and 2:\n- \\(13 - 2 = 11\\)\n- \\(13 + 2 = 15\\)\n- \\(13 * 2 = 26\\)\n- \\(13 / 2 = 6.5\\)\n\nAgain, none of these results directly lead to 24, so let's try combining other numbers first.\n\n### Step 4: Combine 12 and 2\nNow, consider combining 12 and 2:\n- \\(12 + 2 = 14\\)\n- \\(12 - 2 = 10\\)\n- \\(12 * 2 = 24\\)\n- \\(12 / 2 = 6\\)\n\nHere, we notice that \\(12 * 2 = 24\\). This seems promising, but let's verify if we've used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the solution\nUsing \\(12 * 2 = 24\\), we have:\n- \\(12\\) (used once)\n- \\(2\\) (used once)\n- \\(13\\) (not used)\n- \\(13\\) (not used)\n\nThis doesn't satisfy the rule of using all four numbers exactly once. So, this approach is invalid.\n\n### Step 6: Try a different approach\nLet's try using division. Consider dividing 12 by 2:\n- \\(12 / 2 = 6\\)\n\nNow, multiply this result by one of the 13s:\n- \\(6 * 13 = 78\\)\n\nThis is too large, so let's try subtracting the other 13:\n- \\(78 - 13 = 65\\)\n\nStill not 24. Let's try a different combination.\n\n### Step 7: Combine 13 and 12\nNext, consider combining 13 and 12:\n- \\(13 - 12 = 1\\)\n- \\(13 + 12 = 25\\)\n- \\(13 * 12 = 156\\)\n- \\(13 / 12 \\approx 1.0833\\)\n\nThese results don't seem helpful either.

Let's explore different ways to combine them using the allowed operations.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining 12 and 12\nFirst, let's see what happens when we combine the two 12s:\n- \\(12 + 12 = 24\\), but this only uses two numbers and doesn't involve 6 and 9.\n- \\(12 * 12 = 144\\), which is too large.\n- \\(12 - 12 = 0\\), which might be useful in combination with other numbers.\n- \\(12 / 12 = 1\\), which also might be useful.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate 6 and 9\nNow, let's try to use 6 and 9 in combination with the results from Step 2.\n\n#### Option 1: Using \\(12 / 12 = 1\\)\nIf we divide one 12 by the other, we get 1. Now we have 6, 9, and 1 left. Let's see how we can combine these:\n- \\(6 + 9 + 1 = 16\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(6 * 9 * 1 = 54\\), which is too large.\n- \\(9 - 6 = 3\\), then \\(3 * 1 = 3\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(9 / 6 = 1.5\\), then \\(1.5 * 1 = 1.5\\), which is not 24.\n\nThis option doesn't seem promising.\n\n#### Option 2: Using \\(12 - 12 = 0\\)\nIf we subtract one 12 from the other, we get 0. Now we have 6, 9, and 0 left. Let's see how we can combine these:\n- \\(6 + 9 + 0 = 15\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(6 * 9 * 0 = 0\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(9 - 6 = 3\\), then \\(3 * 0 = 0\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(9 / 6 = 1.5\\), then \\(1.5 * 0 = 0\\), which is not 24.\n\nThis option also doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 3: Using \\(12 + 12 = 24\\)\nIf we add the two 12s, we already have 24. Now we need to incorporate 6 and 9 without changing the result. One way to do this is to multiply or divide 6 and 9 by 1, which doesn't change their value:\n- \\(6 * (12 + 12) * (9 - 9) = 6 * 24 * 0 = 0\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(6 + (12 * (12 - 9)) = 6 + (12 * 3) = 6 + 36 = 42\\), which is not 24.\n- \\(6 * (12 / (12 - 9)) = 6 * (12 / 3) = 6 * 4 = 24\\).\n\nThis works!

Let's explore different ways to combine them using the allowed operations.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining 12 and 12\nFirst, consider the two 12s:\n- \\(12 + 12 = 24\\)\n- \\(12 - 12 = 0\\)\n- \\(12 * 12 = 144\\)\n- \\(12 / 12 = 1\\)\n\nThe sum \\(12 + 12 = 24\\) is interesting, but we still need to incorporate the 1 and 8.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate the remaining numbers\nIf we use \\(12 + 12 = 24\\), we need to find a way to include 1 and 8 without changing the result. One way to do this is to multiply or divide 24 by 1 and then add 8:\n\\[24 * 1 + 8 = 32\\] (This doesn't work)\n\\[24 / 1 + 8 = 32\\] (This also doesn't work)\n\nAlternatively, we can try to use 1 and 8 in a way that cancels out their effect. For example:\n\\[12 + (12 * (8 - 1)) = 12 + (12 * 7) = 12 + 84 = 96\\] (This is too large)\n\\[12 + (12 / (8 - 1)) = 12 + (12 / 7) \\approx 12 + 1.714 = 13.714\\] (This is too small)\n\n### Step 4: Use division creatively\nLet's try dividing one of the 12s by 1 and then adding the other 12:\n\\[12 / 1 + 12 = 12 + 12 = 24\\]\nBut we still need to use the second 12. This approach doesn't work because we haven't used both 12s.\n\n### Step 5: Combine all four numbers\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a single expression:\n\\[12 * (12 - (8 + 1)) = 12 * (12 - 9) = 12 * 3 = 36\\] (This is too large)\n\\[12 * (8 - (12 / 1)) = 12 * (8 - 12) = 12 * (-4) = -48\\] (This is negative, so it's invalid)\n\n### Step 6: Use division and multiplication together\nLet's try multiplying two numbers and then dividing by another:\n\\[(12 * 12) / (8 - 1) = 144 / 7 \\approx 20.571\\] (This is not 24)\n\n### Step 7: Final attempt\nLet's try this combination:\n\\[12 + (12 * (8 - 1)) = 12 + (12 * 7) = 12 + 84 = 96\\] (Still too large)\n\nWait, let's try this differently:\n\\[12 * (12 - (8 + 1)) = 12 * (12 - 9) = 12 * 3 = 36\\] (Still too large)\n\nHmm, let's try this:\n\\[12 * (8 - (12 / 1)) = 12 * (8 - 12) = 12 * (-4) = -48\\] (Still negative, so invalid)\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\\[12 + (12 * (8 -

We need to use these to reach 24.\n\n### Step 3: Use subtraction\nSubtract 5 from 36:\n36 - 5 = 31\n\nNow, subtract 12 from 31:\n31 - 12 = 19\n\nThis gives us 19, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try another approach\nLet's try dividing one 6 by the other:\n6 / 6 = 1\n\nNow, we have 1, 5, and 12 left. This doesn't seem helpful.\n\n### Step 5: Combine 5 and 12\nAdd 5 and 12:\n5 + 12 = 17\n\nNow, multiply this by one of the 6s:\n17 * 6 = 102\n\nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 6: Use parentheses to change precedence\nLet's try grouping 12 and 5 first:\n(12 - 5) = 7\n\nNow, multiply this by one of the 6s:\n7 * 6 = 42\n\nAgain, this is too large.\n\n### Step 7: Try a different combination\nLet's divide 12 by 6:\n12 / 6 = 2\n\nNow, we have 2, 5, and 6 left. Multiply these:\n2 * 5 * 6 = 60\n\nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 8: Final attempt\nLet's try adding 5 and 6:\n5 + 6 = 11\n\nNow, multiply this by one of the 6s:\n11 * 6 = 66\n\nFinally, subtract the other 6:\n66 - 6 = 60\n\nThis is still not 24.\n\n### Step 9: Correct solution\nAfter several attempts, let's try this combination:\n\nMultiply 6 and 5:\n6 * 5 = 30\n\nNow, subtract 12:\n30 - 12 = 18\n\nFinally, add the other 6:\n18 + 6 = 24\n\nThis works!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(6 * 5) - 12 + 6 = 24}"}

{"puzzle": "2 7 12 12", "response": "Let's solve the problem step by step using the numbers 2, 7, 12, and 12.\n\n### Step 1: Identify possible combinations\nWe need to use all four numbers exactly once. Let's explore different ways to combine them using the allowed operations.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining 12 and 12\nFirst, consider the two 12s:\n- \\(12 + 12 = 24\\)\n- \\(12 - 12 = 0\\)\n- \\(12 * 12 = 144\\)\n- \\(12 / 12 = 1\\)\n\nThe sum \\(12 + 12 = 24\\) is interesting, but we still need to incorporate the 2 and 7.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate 2 and 7\nIf we use \\(12 + 12 = 24\\), we need to find a way to include 2 and 7 without changing the result. One way to do this is to multiply or divide 2 and 7 by 1, which doesn't change their value.\n\n### Step 4: Use multiplication or division\nLet's try multiplying 2 and 7:\n\\[2 * 7 = 14\\]\n\nNow, add this to one of the results from Step 2:\n\\[14 + 24 = 38\\] (This is too high.)\n\\[14 + 24 - 12 = 20\\] (This is too low.)\n\nAlternatively, let's try dividing 7 by 2:\n\\[7 / 2 = 3.5\\]\n\nAdd this to one of the results from Step 2:\n\\[14 + 3.5 = 17.5\\] (This is too low.)\n\\[14 + 3.5 + 12 = 29.5\\] (This is too high.)\n\n### Step 5: Combine operations\nLet's try combining addition and multiplication:\n\\[12 + 12 = 24\\]\n\\[2 + 7 = 9\\]\n\\[2 * 7 = 14\\]\n\\[12 * (2 + 7) = 12 * 9 = 108\\] (This is too high.)\n\\[12 * (7 - 2) = 12 * 5 = 60\\] (This is too high.)\n\n### Step 6: Use division creatively\nLet's try dividing one of the 12s by 2:\n\\[12 / 2 = 6\\]\n\nNow, multiply this by the other 12 and 7:\n\\[6 * 12 = 72\\]\n\\[72 / 7 \\approx 10.2857\\] (This is too low.)\n\n### Step 7: Final combination\nAfter exploring various combinations, let's try this approach:\n\n1. Subtract 2 from 7:\n\\[7 - 2 = 5\\]\n\n2. Multiply this result by one of the 12s:\n\\[5 * 12 = 60\\]\n\n3.

Subtract 2 from 7:\n\\[7 - 2 = 5\\]\n\n2. Multiply this result by one of the 12s:\n\\[5 * 12 = 60\\]\n\n3. Divide this result by the other 12:\n\\[60 / 12 = 5\\] (This is too low.)\n\nWait, this still doesn't work. Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. Multiply 2 and 7:\n\\[2 * 7 = 14\\]\n\n2.

Subtract the other 12:\n\\[26 - 12 = 14\\] (This is too low.)\n\n### Step 9: Final solution\nAfter thorough exploration, the correct combination is:\n\n1. Divide one of the 12s by 2:\n\\[12 / 2 = 6\\]\n\n2. Multiply this result by the other 12:\n\\[6 * 12 = 72\\]\n\n3.

{"puzzle": "3 5 5 12", "response": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 12 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 3, 5, 5, and 12 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways. Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Attempt 1: Multiply 12 and 2**\n   - To get 2, we can subtract 5 from 3: \\(3 - 5 = -2\\). This doesn't help us reach 24.\n\n2. **Attempt 2: Use division**\n   - Let's try dividing 12 by something. For example:\n     - \\(12 / (5 - 3) = 12 / 2 = 6\\). Now we have 6, 5 left. We can multiply 6 and 5: \\(6 * 5 = 30\\). This is too high.\n\n3. **Attempt 3: Combine 5 and 5**\n   - Let's try adding 5 and 5: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\). Now we have 10, 3, 12 left. We can multiply 10 and 3: \\(10 * 3 = 30\\). Then subtract 12: \\(30 - 12 = 18\\). This is too low.\n\n4. **Attempt 4: Use subtraction**\n   - Let's try subtracting 3 from 12: \\(12 - 3 = 9\\). Now we have 9, 5, 5 left. We can multiply 9 and 5: \\(9 * 5 = 45\\). Then divide by the other 5: \\(45 / 5 = 9\\). This is too low.\n\n5. **Attempt 5: Use multiplication and division**\n   - Let's try multiplying 5 and 5: \\(5 * 5 = 25\\). Now we have 25, 3, 12 left. We can subtract 3 from 25: \\(25 - 3 = 22\\). Then add 12: \\(22 + 12 = 34\\). This is too high.\n\n6. **Attempt 6: Use parentheses to change precedence**\n   - Let's try grouping 12 and 5 first:\n     - \\(12 / (5 - 3) = 12 / 2 = 6\\). Now we have 6, 5 left. We can multiply 6 and 5: \\(6 * 5 = 30\\). This is too high.\n\n7. **Attempt 7: Combine 3 and 5**\n   - Let's try multiplying 3 and 5: \\(3 * 5 = 15\\). Now we have 15, 5, 12 left. We can add 15 and 5: \\(15 + 5 = 20\\). Then add 12: \\(20 + 12 = 32\\). This is too high.\n\n8. **Attempt 8: Use division and multiplication**\n   - Let's try dividing 12 by 3: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\). Now we have 4, 5, 5 left. We can multiply 4 and 5: \\(4 * 5 = 20\\). Then add 5: \\(20 + 5 = 25\\). This is close but not 24.\n\n9. **Attempt 9: Use subtraction and multiplication**\n   - Let's try subtracting 3 from 5: \\(5 - 3 = 2\\). Now we have 2, 5, 12 left. We can multiply 2 and 5: \\(2 * 5 = 10\\). Then add 12: \\(10 + 12 = 22\\). This is too low.\n\n10. **Attempt 10: Use all four numbers together**\n    - Let's try combining all four numbers in one expression:\n      - \\(12 / (5 - (5 / 3)) = 12 / (5 - 1.666...) = 12 / 3.333... = 3.6\\).

{"puzzle": "2 6 11 12", "response": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 2, 6, 11, and 12 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 2, 6, 11, and 12 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways. Let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Subtract 2 from 12**:  \n   \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply the result by 6**:  \n   \\( 10 * 6 = 60 \\)\n\n3. **Divide by 11**:  \n   \\( 60 / 11 \\approx 5.4545... \\)  \n   This does not give us 24.\n\n### Step 3: Try another combination\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n1. **Add 6 and 11**:  \n   \\( 6 + 11 = 17 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply by 2**:  \n   \\( 17 * 2 = 34 \\)\n\n3. **Subtract 12**:  \n   \\( 34 - 12 = 22 \\)  \n   This also does not give us 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try using division\nLet's try dividing one of the numbers:\n\n1. **Divide 12 by 2**:  \n   \\( 12 / 2 = 6 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply by 6**:  \n   \\( 6 * 6 = 36 \\)\n\n3. **Subtract 11**:  \n   \\( 36 - 11 = 25 \\)  \n   This is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 5: Combine operations with parentheses\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n1. **Subtract 2 from 11**:  \n   \\( 11 - 2 = 9 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply by 6**:  \n   \\( 9 * 6 = 54 \\)\n\n3. **Divide by 12**:  \n   \\( 54 / 12 = 4.5 \\)  \n   This does not give us 24.\n\n### Step 6: Try a different combination with parentheses\nLet's try another approach:\n\n1. **Add 6 and 12**:  \n   \\( 6 + 12 = 18 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply by 2**:  \n   \\( 18 * 2 = 36 \\)\n\n3. **Subtract 11**:  \n   \\( 36 - 11 = 25 \\)  \n   This is still not 24.\n\n### Step 7: Final attempt\nLet's try this combination:\n\n1. **Multiply 6 and 2**:  \n   \\( 6 * 2 = 12 \\)\n\n2. **Add 11**:  \n   \\( 12 + 11 = 23 \\)\n\n3. **Add 12**:  \n   \\( 23 + 12 = 35 \\)  \n   This is too high.\n\n### Step 8: Correct solution\nAfter several attempts, here is the correct combination:\n\n1. **Subtract 2 from 12**:  \n   \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\)\n\n2. **Multiply by 6**:  \n   \\( 10 * 6 = 60 \\)\n\n3. **Divide by 11**:  \n   \\( 60 / 11 \\approx 5.4545... \\)  \n   This does not work.\n\nWait, let's try a different approach:\n\n1. **Multiply 6 and 2**:  \n   \\( 6 * 2 = 12 \\)\n\n2. **Add 11**:  \n   \\( 12 +

Let's explore different ways to combine them using the allowed operations.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining 11 and 11\nFirst, consider the two 11s:\n- \\(11 + 11 = 22\\)\n- \\(11 - 11 = 0\\)\n- \\(11 * 11 = 121\\)\n- \\(11 / 11 = 1\\)\n\nNone of these results seem immediately helpful, so let's try combining them with the other numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Combine 11 and 13\nNow, consider \\(11 + 13 = 24\\). This seems promising, but we still have one 11 left unused. We need to find a way to incorporate the remaining 11 into the equation.\n\n### Step 4: Incorporate the remaining 11\nOne way to do this is to subtract the remaining 11 from the result of \\(11 + 13 = 24\\):\n\\[24 - 11 = 13\\]\nThis doesn't give us 24, so this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 5: Try a different approach\nInstead of adding the two 11s first, let's try multiplying them:\n\\[11 * 11 = 121\\]\nNow, we need to reduce 121 to 24 using the remaining numbers (2 and 13).\n\n### Step 6: Divide 121 by 2\nDivide 121 by 2:\n\\[121 / 2 = 60.5\\]\nThis is too high.\n\n### Step 7: Subtract 13 from 121\nSubtract 13 from 121:\n\\[121 - 13 = 108\\]\nStill too high.\n\n### Step 8: Try another combination\nLet's try dividing 13 by 2:\n\\[13 / 2 = 6.5\\]\nNow, multiply this by one of the 11s:\n\\[6.5 * 11 = 73.5\\]\nStill too high.\n\n### Step 9: Combine 11 and 2\nLet's try adding 11 and 2:\n\\[11 + 2 = 13\\]\nNow, multiply this by the other 11:\n\\[13 * 11 = 143\\]\nToo high.\n\n### Step 10: Final attempt\nLet's try subtracting 2 from 13:\n\\[13 - 2 = 11\\]\nNow, multiply this by one of the 11s:\n\\[11 * 11 = 121\\]\nStill too high.\n\n### Step 11: Correct solution\nAfter several attempts, here's the correct combination:\n\\[\n(13 - (11 / 11)) * 2 = (13 - 1) * 2 = 12 * 2 = 24\n\\]\n\nThis uses all four numbers exactly once and follows the rules.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(13 - (11 / 11)) * 2}"}
