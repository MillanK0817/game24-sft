Adding or subtracting them would change the result.\n\n### Step 3: Combine operations\nLet's try combining multiplication and division:\n- \\( 12 \\times (6 - 5) = 12 \\times 1 = 12 \\) (Still not 24.)\n\nNow, let's try using division with the 12s:\n- \\( 12 / (12 / (6 - 5)) = 12 / (12 / 1) = 12 / 12 = 1 \\) (Not helpful.)\n\n### Step 4: Use all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try using all four numbers in a single expression:\n- \\( (12 - (12 / 6)) \\times 5 = (12 - 2) \\times 5 = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) (Too large.)\n\n### Step 5: Try a different approach\nLet's try using division and multiplication differently:\n- \\( 12 \\times (5 - (12 / 6)) = 12 \\times (5 - 2) = 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\) (Still not 24.)\n\n### Step 6: Final attempt\nLet's try using the numbers in this order:\n- \\( (12 / (12 / 6)) \\times 5 = (12 / 2) \\times 5 = 6 \\times 5 = 30 \\) (Not 24.)\n\n### Step 7: Correct solution\nAfter several attempts, here's the correct way to combine the numbers:\n- \\( (12 - (12 / 6)) \\times 5 = (12 - 2) \\times 5 = 10 \\times 5 = 50 \\) (Still not 24.)\n\nWait, let's try another approach:\n- \\( 12 \\times (6 - (12 / 5)) = 12 \\times (6 - 2.4) = 12 \\times 3.6 = 43.2 \\) (Not 24.)\n\n### Step 8: Correct solution\nFinally, here's the correct combination:\n- \\( (12 \\times (6 - 5)) + 12 = (12 \\times 1) + 12 = 12 + 12 = 24 \\)\n\nThis uses all four numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\n\\boxed{(12 * (6 - 5)) + 12 = 24}",

Let's consider the following approach:\n\n1. Use 12 and 10 first, as they are the largest numbers and might simplify the problem.\n2. Subtract 10 from 12: \\(12 - 10 = 2\\).\n3.

Still not 24.\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluate and try a different strategy\nLet's try to use division and multiplication together:\n\n1. Divide 12 by 3: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).\n2. Multiply 6 and 10: \\(6 * 10 = 60\\).\n3. Divide 60 by 4: \\(60 / 4 = 15\\). This is not 24.\n\nLet's try another combination:\n\n1. Multiply 6 and 3: \\(6 * 3 = 18\\).\n2.

Still not 24.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter trying various combinations, it seems challenging to reach 24 using the numbers 3, 6, 10, and 12 with the given operations. However, let's try one more approach:\n\n1. Subtract 6 from 12: \\(12 - 6 = 6\\).\n2. Multiply 10 and 3: \\(10 * 3 = 30\\).\n3. Subtract the result from step 1: \\(30 - 6 = 24\\).\n\nThis combination works! Here's the final equation:\n\n\\boxed{(10 * 3) - (12 - 6) = 24}",

Let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Multiply 5 and 8**: \\(5 * 8 = 40\\). Now we have 40, 1, and 10 left. We need to use 1 and 10 to reduce 40 to 24. For example, \\(40 - 10 - 1 = 29\\), which is not 24. Alternatively, \\(40 / 10 = 4\\), and \\(4 * 1 = 4\\), which is not 24.\n\n2. **Multiply 10 and 1**: \\(10 * 1 = 10\\). Now we have 10, 5, and 8 left. We need to use 5 and 8 to combine with 10 to get 24. For example, \\(10 + 5 + 8 = 23\\), which is not 24. Alternatively, \\(10 * (8 - 5) = 10 * 3 = 30\\), which is not 24.\n\n3. **Add 10 and 5**: \\(10 + 5 = 15\\). Now we have 15, 1, and 8 left. We need to use 1 and 8 to combine with 15 to get 24.

Let\u2019s see how we can combine these:\n- 8 * 1 = 8.\n- Now we have 2 and 8. Multiplying these gives 2 * 8 = 16, which is not 24.\n\nThis approach doesn\u2019t work, so let\u2019s try another combination.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try a different approach\nLet\u2019s use 8 and 1 first:\n- 8 - 1 = 7.\n\nNow we have the numbers 7, 12, and 6 left. Let\u2019s see how we can combine these:\n- 12 - 6 = 6.\n- Now we have 7 and 6.

Let\u2019s see how we can combine these:\n- 12 - 8 = 4.\n- Now we have 6 and 4. Multiplying these gives 6 * 4 = 24.\n\nThis works!

Let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24.\n\n- 3 * 5 = 15\n- 3 * 6 = 18\n- 3 * 12 = 36\n- 5 * 6 = 30\n- 5 * 12 = 60\n- 6 * 12 = 72\n\nNone of these products are 24, but some are close. Let's see if we can adjust them using the remaining numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Combine operations\nLet's try combining multiplication with addition or subtraction.\n\n- 6 * 5 = 30, then 30 - 12 = 18, and 18 + 3 = 21 (Not 24)\n- 12 * 3 = 36, then 36 - 6 = 30, and 30 - 5 = 25 (Not 24)\n- 12 * 2 = 24, but we don't have a 2. However, we can create a 2 by dividing 6 by 3.\n\n### Step 4: Create a 2 by dividing 6 by 3\n- 6 / 3 = 2\n\nNow, multiply this result by 12:\n- 12 * 2 = 24\n\nBut we still need to use the number 5. Let's see how we can incorporate 5 into the equation.\n\n### Step 5: Incorporate the number 5\nWe can add 5 and then subtract 5 to keep the equation balanced:\n- 12 * (6 / 3) + 5 - 5 = 24\n\nHowever, this is not efficient. Let's try another approach.\n\n### Step 6: Use division and multiplication together\nLet's try dividing 12 by 3:\n- 12 / 3 = 4\n\nNow, multiply this result by 6:\n- 4 * 6 = 24\n\nBut we still need to use the number 5. Let's see how we can incorporate 5 into the equation.\n\n### Step 7: Incorporate the number 5\nWe can add 5 and then subtract 5 to keep the equation balanced:\n- (12 / 3) * 6 + 5 - 5 = 24\n\nAgain, this is not efficient. Let's try another approach.\n\n### Step 8: Combine all operations\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a single equation:\n- (12 - (6 / 3)) * 5 = (12 - 2) * 5 = 10 * 5 = 50 (Not 24)\n- (12 / (6 / 3)) * 5 = (12 / 2) * 5 = 6 * 5 = 30 (Not 24)\n- (12 * 5) / (6 / 3) = 60 / 2 = 30 (Not 24)\n\n### Step 9: Try a different combination\nLet's try using subtraction and multiplication:\n- (12 - 5) * (6 - 3) = 7 * 3 = 21 (Not 24)\n\n### Step 10: Final solution\nAfter trying various combinations, let's try the following:\n- (12 / (6 / (5 - 3))) = 12 / (6 / 2) = 12 / 3 = 4 (Not 24)\n\nWait, that doesn't work. Let's try another approach:\n- (12 * (5 - (6 / 3))) = 12 * (5 - 2) = 12 * 3 = 36 (Not 24)\n\nHmm, still not 24. Let's try:\n- (12 + 6) * (5 - 3) = 18 * 2 = 36 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 3) - (6 * 5) = 36 - 30 = 6 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * (6 / (5 - 3))) = 12 * (6 / 2) = 12 * 3 = 36 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 + 6 + 5 + 3) = 26 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 5) / (6 + 3) = 60 / 9 \u2248 6.666 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * (5 - (6 / 3))) = 12 * (5 - 2) = 12 * 3 = 36 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 / (5 - (6 / 3))) = 12 / (5 - 2) = 12 / 3 = 4 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 5) - (6 * 3) = 60 - 18 = 42 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 + 5) * (6 - 3) = 17 * 3 = 51 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 6) / (5 + 3) = 72 / 8 = 9 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 5) / (6 - 3) = 60 / 3 = 20 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 + 6) * (5 / 3) = 18 * (5 / 3) = 18 * 1.666 \u2248 30 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * (5 + 3)) / 6 = (12 * 8) / 6 = 96 / 6 = 16 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 5) - (6 + 3) = 60 - 9 = 51 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 6) - (5 * 3) = 72 - 15 = 57 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 + 5 + 6 + 3) = 26 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * 5) / (6 / 3) = 60 / 2 = 30 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * (6 / (5 - 3))) = 12 * (6 / 2) = 12 * 3 = 36 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 / (5 - (6 / 3))) = 12 / (5 - 2) = 12 / 3 = 4 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 * (5 - (6 / 3))) = 12 * (5 - 2) = 12 * 3 = 36 (Not 24)\n\nWait, let's try:\n- (12 + (6 * (5 - 3))) = 12 + (6 * 2) = 12 + 12 = 24\n\nYes! This works.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{12 + (6 * (5 - 3)) = 24}",

Since there are three 8s, we might consider using division or subtraction to reduce the number of 8s.\n\n### Step 3: Try combining two 8s\nLet's try dividing one 8 by another 8:\n8 / 8 = 1\n\nNow we have the numbers 5, 8, and 1 left.

Combining these:\n5 + 8 + 64 = 77 (Not 24)\n5 * 8 * 64 = 2560 (Not 24)\n5 * (8 + 64) = 360 (Not 24)\n(5 + 8) * 64 = 832 (Not 24)\n\nThis approach doesn't work either.\n\n### Step 6: Try combining 5 and 8\nLet's try combining 5 and 8 first:\n5 + 8 = 13\n5 * 8 = 40\n8 - 5 = 3\n5 / 8 = 0.625\n\nNow we have the numbers 13, 8, and 8 left (or 40, 8, and 8, etc.).

        "output": "Let's solve the problem step by step using the numbers 7, 9, 12, and 12.\n\n### Step 1: Identify possible combinations\nWe need to use all four numbers exactly once. Let's explore different combinations of operations.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining the two 12s\nSince there are two 12s, we can try combining them first:\n- 12 + 12 = 24\n- 12 - 12 = 0\n- 12 * 12 = 144\n- 12 / 12 = 1\n\nThe addition of the two 12s gives us 24, but we still need to incorporate the 7 and 9. If we use 12 + 12 = 24, we need to find a way to use 7 and 9 without changing the result. However, any operation with 7 and 9 will alter the result, so this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 3: Try using multiplication and division\nLet's consider multiplying 12 and 12:\n- 12 * 12 = 144\n\nNow, we need to use 7 and 9 to reduce 144 to 24. We can try dividing 144 by (9 - 7):\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n- 144 / 2 = 72\n\nThis gives us 72, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try combining 7 and 9 first\nLet's try combining 7 and 9:\n- 7 + 9 = 16\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n- 7 * 9 = 63\n- 9 / 7 \u2248 1.2857\n\nNow, let's see how we can use these results with the two 12s.\n\n### Step 5: Use the result of 9 - 7 = 2\nIf we use 9 - 7 = 2, we can then multiply it by one of the 12s:\n- 12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow, we need to incorporate the other 12. We can divide 24 by 12:\n- 24 / 12 = 2\n\nThis gives us 2, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 6: Try using 7 + 9 = 16\nIf we use 7 + 9 = 16, we can then add one of the 12s:\n- 16 + 12 = 28\n\nNow, we need to incorporate the other 12. We can subtract 12 from 28:\n- 28 - 12 = 16\n\nThis gives us 16, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 7: Try using 7 * 9 = 63\nIf we use 7 * 9 = 63, we can then divide by one of the 12s:\n- 63 / 12 = 5.25\n\nNow, we need to incorporate the other 12. We can multiply 5.25 by 12:\n- 5.25 * 12 = 63\n\nThis gives us 63, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 8: Try using 9 / 7 \u2248 1.2857\nIf we use 9 / 7 \u2248 1.2857, we can then multiply by one of the 12s:\n- 12 * 1.2857 \u2248 15.4284\n\nNow, we need to incorporate the other 12. We can add 12 to 15.4284:\n- 15.4284 + 12 \u2248 27.4284\n\nThis gives us approximately 27.4284, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 9: Try a different approach\nLet's try combining one 12 with 7 and the other 12 with 9:\n- 12 - 7 = 5\n- 12 - 9 = 3\n\nNow, we can multiply these results:\n- 5 * 3 = 15\n\nThis gives us 15, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 10: Try using division and multiplication\nLet's try dividing one 12 by 7:\n- 12 / 7 \u2248 1.7143\n\nNow, multiply this result by 9:\n- 1.7143 * 9 \u2248 15.4284\n\nNow, add the other 12:\n- 15.4284 + 12 \u2248 27.4284\n\nThis gives us approximately 27.4284, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 11: Try using all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a single expression:\n- (12 - (12 / (9 - 7))) * 7\n\nFirst, calculate 9 - 7:\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n\nThen, divide 12 by 2:\n- 12 / 2 = 6\n\nNow, subtract 6 from 12:\n- 12 - 6 = 6\n\nFinally, multiply by 7:\n- 6 * 7 = 42\n\nThis gives us 42, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 12: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n- (12 + 12) * (9 - 7)\n\nFirst, calculate 12 + 12:\n- 12 + 12 = 24\n\nThen, calculate 9 - 7:\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n\nNow, multiply 24 by 2:\n- 24 * 2 = 48\n\nThis gives us 48, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 13: Try using division and addition\nLet's try:\n- (12 / (12 - 9)) * 7\n\nFirst, calculate 12 - 9:\n- 12 - 9 = 3\n\nThen, divide 12 by 3:\n- 12 / 3 = 4\n\nNow, multiply by 7:\n- 4 * 7 = 28\n\nThis gives us 28, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 14: Try using multiplication and subtraction\nLet's try:\n- (12 * 7) - (12 * 9)\n\nFirst, calculate 12 * 7:\n- 12 * 7 = 84\n\nThen, calculate 12 * 9:\n- 12 * 9 = 108\n\nNow, subtract 108 from 84:\n- 84 - 108 = -24\n\nThis gives us -24, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 15: Try using a combination of all operations\nLet's try:\n- (12 + 12) / (9 - 7)\n\nFirst, calculate 12 + 12:\n- 12 + 12 = 24\n\nThen, calculate 9 - 7:\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n\nNow, divide 24 by 2:\n- 24 / 2 = 12\n\nThis gives us 12, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 16: Try using a different combination\nLet's try:\n- 12 * (9 - (12 / 7))\n\nFirst, calculate 12 / 7:\n- 12 / 7 \u2248 1.7143\n\nThen, subtract this from 9:\n- 9 - 1.7143 \u2248 7.2857\n\nNow, multiply by 12:\n- 12 * 7.2857 \u2248 87.4284\n\nThis gives us approximately 87.4284, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 17: Try using a combination of multiplication and division\nLet's try:\n- (12 * 9) / (12 + 7)\n\nFirst, calculate 12 * 9:\n- 12 * 9 = 108\n\nThen, calculate 12 + 7:\n- 12 + 7 = 19\n\nNow, divide 108 by 19:\n- 108 / 19 \u2248 5.6842\n\nThis gives us approximately 5.6842, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 18: Try using a combination of subtraction and division\nLet's try:\n- (12 - (9 / 7)) * 12\n\nFirst, calculate 9 / 7:\n- 9 / 7 \u2248 1.2857\n\nThen, subtract this from 12:\n- 12 - 1.2857 \u2248 10.7143\n\nNow, multiply by 12:\n- 10.7143 * 12 \u2248 128.5716\n\nThis gives us approximately 128.5716, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 19: Try using a combination of all operations\nLet's try:\n- (12 * (9 - 7)) + 12\n\nFirst, calculate 9 - 7:\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n\nThen, multiply by 12:\n- 12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow, add 12:\n- 24 + 12 = 36\n\nThis gives us 36, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 20: Try using a combination of division and multiplication\nLet's try:\n- (12 / (9 - 7)) * 12\n\nFirst, calculate 9 - 7:\n- 9 - 7 = 2\n\nThen, divide 12 by 2:\n- 12 / 2 = 6\n\nNow, multiply by 12:\n- 6 * 12 = 72\n\nThis gives us 72, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 21: Try using a combination of all operations\nLet's try:\n- (12 + 12) * (9 / 7)\n\nFirst, calculate 12 + 12:\n- 12 + 12 = 24\n\nThen, calculate 9 / 7:\n- 9 / 7 \u2248 1.2857\n\nNow, multiply 24 by 1.2857:\n- 24 * 1.2857 \u2248 30.8568\n\nThis gives us approximately 30.8568, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 22: Try using a combination of subtraction and multiplication\nLet's try:\n- (12 * 9) - (12 * 7)\n\nFirst, calculate 12 * 9:\n- 12 * 9 = 108\n\nThen, calculate 12 * 7:\n- 12 * 7 = 84\n\nNow, subtract 84 from 108:\n- 108 - 84 = 24\n\nThis gives us 24, and we have used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 * 9) - (12 * 7) = 24}",

This seems difficult.\n\n2. **Attempt 2: Multiply 6 and 2**\n   - 6 * 2 = 12\n   - Now we need to use 1 and 7 to combine with 12 to get 24. For example:\n     - 12 + 7 + 1 = 20 (not 24)\n     - 12 * (7 - 1) = 12 * 6 = 72 (too large)\n\n3. **Attempt 3: Use division**\n   - 6 / (1 + 2) = 6 / 3 = 2\n   - Now we need to use 7 to combine with 2 to get 24. For example:\n     - 2 * 7 = 14 (not 24)\n     - 2 + 7 = 9 (not 24)\n\n4. **Attempt 4: Combine 7 and 1**\n   - 7 - 1 = 6\n   - Now we have two 6s and a 2. For example:\n     - 6 * 6 = 36\n     - 36 / 2 = 18 (not 24)\n\n5. **Attempt 5: Use parentheses creatively**\n   - (7 - 1) = 6\n   - Now we have 6, 6, and 2. For example:\n     - 6 * (6 - 2) = 6 * 4 = 24\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\nThe expression (7 - 1) * (6 - 2) uses all the numbers 1, 2, 6, and 7 exactly once. Let's calculate:\n- (7 - 1) = 6\n- (6 - 2) = 4\n- 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThis satisfies all the rules of the game.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(7 - 1) * (6 - 2)}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 3, 5, 8, and 11 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 3, 5, 8, and 11 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways. Let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Multiply 8 and 3**:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we need to incorporate 5 and 11 into this equation. However, simply adding or subtracting 5 and 11 will not keep the result at 24.\n\n2. **Subtract 5 from 11**:  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   Now we have the numbers 3, 6, and 8 left. We can try to combine these numbers to get 24.\n\n3. **Multiply 6 and 4**:  \n   \\( 6 * 4 = 24 \\)  \n   However, we don't have a 4 in our numbers. This approach doesn't work.\n\n4. **Multiply 8 and 3**:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we need to incorporate 5 and 11. Let's try to use division or addition.\n\n5. **Divide 11 by 5**:  \n   \\( 11 / 5 = 2.2 \\)  \n   Now we have 3, 8, and 2.2. Multiplying 8 and 3 gives 24, but we still have 2.2 left, which doesn't help.\n\n6. **Add 5 and 3**:  \n   \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\)  \n   Now we have 8, 8, and 11. Multiplying 8 and 8 gives 64, which is too large.\n\n7. **Subtract 3 from 11**:  \n   \\( 11 - 3 = 8 \\)  \n   Now we have 5, 8, and 8. Multiplying 8 and 8 gives 64, which is too large.\n\n8. **Multiply 5 and 3**:  \n   \\( 5 * 3 = 15 \\)  \n   Now we have 8, 11, and 15. Adding 8 and 11 gives 19, and adding 15 gives 34, which is too large.\n\n9. **Divide 8 by 3**:  \n   \\( 8 / 3 \\approx 2.666 \\)  \n   Now we have 5, 11, and 2.666. Multiplying 5 and 11 gives 55, which is too large.\n\n10. **Add 5 and 8**:  \n    \\( 5 + 8 = 13 \\)  \n    Now we have 3, 11, and 13. Multiplying 3 and 11 gives 33, which is too large.\n\n### Step 3: Try a different approach\nLet's try to use parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n1. **Subtract 5 from 11**:  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   Now we have 3, 6, and 8. We can try to multiply 6 and 8:  \n   \\( 6 * 8 = 48 \\)  \n   Now we have 3 and 48. Dividing 48 by 3 gives 16, which is not 24.\n\n2. **Multiply 8 and 3**:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we have 5 and 11. We can try to subtract 5 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   Now we have 24 and 6. Dividing 24 by 6 gives 4, which is not 24.\n\n3. **Multiply 5 and 3**:  \n   \\( 5 * 3 = 15 \\)  \n   Now we have 8 and 11. We can try to add 8 and 11:  \n   \\( 8 + 11 = 19 \\)  \n   Now we have 15 and 19. Adding 15 and 19 gives 34, which is too large.\n\n4. **Divide 11 by 5**:  \n   \\( 11 / 5 = 2.2 \\)  \n   Now we have 3, 8, and 2.2. Multiplying 8 and 3 gives 24, but we still have 2.2 left, which doesn't help.\n\n### Step 4: Combine operations\nLet's try to combine multiple operations in a single expression.\n\n1. **Multiply 8 and 3**:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we need to incorporate 5 and 11. Let's try to subtract 5 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   Now we have 24 and 6. Dividing 24 by 6 gives 4, which is not 24.\n\n2. **Multiply 5 and 3**:  \n   \\( 5 * 3 = 15 \\)  \n   Now we have 8 and 11. We can try to subtract 8 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 8 = 3 \\)  \n   Now we have 15 and 3. Multiplying 15 and 3 gives 45, which is too large.\n\n3. **Multiply 8 and 5**:  \n   \\( 8 * 5 = 40 \\)  \n   Now we have 3 and 11. We can try to subtract 3 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 3 = 8 \\)  \n   Now we have 40 and 8. Dividing 40 by 8 gives 5, which is not 24.\n\n4. **Multiply 11 and 3**:  \n   \\( 11 * 3 = 33 \\)  \n   Now we have 5 and 8. We can try to subtract 5 from 8:  \n   \\( 8 - 5 = 3 \\)  \n   Now we have 33 and 3. Dividing 33 by 3 gives 11, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 5: Try a more complex expression\nLet's try to use parentheses to combine operations in a more complex way.\n\n1. **Subtract 5 from 11**:  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   Now we have 3, 6, and 8. We can try to multiply 6 and 8:  \n   \\( 6 * 8 = 48 \\)  \n   Now we have 3 and 48. Dividing 48 by 3 gives 16, which is not 24.\n\n2. **Multiply 8 and 3**:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we have 5 and 11. We can try to subtract 5 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   Now we have 24 and 6. Dividing 24 by 6 gives 4, which is not 24.\n\n3. **Multiply 5 and 3**:  \n   \\( 5 * 3 = 15 \\)  \n   Now we have 8 and 11. We can try to subtract 8 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 8 = 3 \\)  \n   Now we have 15 and 3. Multiplying 15 and 3 gives 45, which is too large.\n\n4. **Multiply 8 and 5**:  \n   \\( 8 * 5 = 40 \\)  \n   Now we have 3 and 11. We can try to subtract 3 from 11:  \n   \\( 11 - 3 = 8 \\)  \n   Now we have 40 and 8. Dividing 40 by 8 gives 5, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 6: Try a different combination\nLet's try to use division and multiplication together.\n\n1. **Divide 8 by 3**:  \n   \\( 8 / 3 \\approx 2.666 \\)  \n   Now we have 5, 11, and 2.666. We can try to multiply 5 and 11:  \n   \\( 5 * 11 = 55 \\)  \n   Now we have 55 and 2.666. Dividing 55 by 2.666 gives approximately 20.625, which is not 24.\n\n2. **Divide 11 by 5**:  \n   \\( 11 / 5 = 2.2 \\)  \n   Now we have 3, 8, and 2.2. We can try to multiply 8 and 3:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we have 24 and 2.2. Dividing 24 by 2.2 gives approximately 10.909, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 7: Try to use all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try to combine all four numbers in a single expression using parentheses.\n\n1. **Expression**: \\( (11 - 5) * (8 - 3) \\)  \n   \\( 11 - 5 = 6 \\)  \n   \\( 8 - 3 = 5 \\)  \n   \\( 6 * 5 = 30 \\)  \n   This is not 24.\n\n2. **Expression**: \\( (11 - 8) * (5 + 3) \\)  \n   \\( 11 - 8 = 3 \\)  \n   \\( 5 + 3 = 8 \\)  \n   \\( 3 * 8 = 24 \\)  \n   This equals 24 and uses all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(11 - 8) * (5 + 3) = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 1, 8, 9, and 12. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 1, 8, 9, and 12 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by looking for combinations of these numbers that could result in 24. Here are some observations:\n- 12 is a large number, so it might be useful in multiplication or division.\n- 8 and 9 are also relatively large numbers, so they could be combined with 12 or 1.\n- 1 is a small number, so it might be used in addition or subtraction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining 12 and 8\nFirst, let's see what happens when we combine 12 and 8:\n- 12 + 8 = 20\n- 12 - 8 = 4\n- 12 * 8 = 96\n- 12 / 8 = 1.5\n\nNone of these results are 24, but we can use them in further calculations.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Incorporate 9 and 1\nNow, let's try incorporating 9 and 1 into the calculations. For example:\n- If we use 12 - 8 = 4, we can try to combine 4 with 9 and 1:\n  - 4 + 9 + 1 = 14 (not 24)\n  - 4 * 9 * 1 = 36 (not 24)\n  - 4 * (9 - 1) = 32 (not 24)\n  - 4 + (9 * 1) = 13 (not 24)\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Use multiplication and division\nLet's try multiplying 12 and 2 (since 8 - 1 = 7, which doesn't help, but 9 - 1 = 8, which is already used). Alternatively, we can divide:\n- 12 / (1 + 8) = 12 / 9 \u2248 1.333 (not useful)\n- 12 / (9 - 1) = 12 / 8 = 1.5 (not useful)\n\nThis doesn't seem promising, so let's try a different strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Combine 9 and 8\nLet's see what happens when we combine 9 and 8:\n- 9 + 8 = 17\n- 9 - 8 = 1\n- 9 * 8 = 72\n- 9 / 8 = 1.125\n\nNow, let's try to incorporate 12 and 1:\n- If we use 9 - 8 = 1, we already have 1, so this doesn't help.\n- If we use 9 + 8 = 17, we can try to combine 17 with 12 and 1:\n  - 17 + 12 + 1 = 30 (not 24)\n  - 17 * 12 * 1 = 204 (not 24)\n  - 17 - 12 - 1 = 4 (not 24)\n  - 17 / (12 - 1) \u2248 1.545 (not useful)\n\nThis doesn't work, so let's try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Use parentheses to change precedence\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:\n- (12 - 9) = 3\n- Now, we can combine 3 with 8 and 1:\n  - 3 * 8 * 1 = 24\n\nThis works! Here's the full expression:\n(12 - 9) * 8 * 1 = 24\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the solution step by step:\n1. 12 - 9 = 3\n2. 3 * 8 = 24\n3. 24 * 1 = 24\n\nThe result is exactly 24, and all numbers (1, 8, 9, 12) are used exactly once.

Alternatively, we can divide 8 by (7 - 1), which gives 8 / 6 \u2248 1.333, which is not 2.\n\n2. **Multiply 8 and 3**: If we can create 3 from the remaining numbers (1, 7, 12), we can multiply it by 8 to get 24.\n   - To create 3 from 1, 7, and 12, we can subtract 1 from 12 and then divide by 7, which gives (12 - 1) / 7 = 11 / 7 \u2248 1.571, which is not 3.\n\n3. **Multiply 7 and 3.428**: If we can create 3.428 from the remaining numbers (1, 8, 12), we can multiply it by 7 to get 24.\n   - To create 3.428 from 1, 8, and 12, we can divide 12 by (8 - 1), which gives 12 / 7 \u2248 1.714, which is not 3.428.\n\n4. **Combine 12 and 8**: Let's try to combine 12 and 8 first.\n   - 12 + 8 = 20, and then we need to use 1 and 7 to get 4, which is not straightforward.\n   - 12 - 8 = 4, and then we need to use 1 and 7 to get 6, which is not straightforward.\n   - 12 * 8 = 96, which is too large.\n   - 12 / 8 = 1.5, and then we need to use 1 and 7 to get 16, which is not straightforward.\n\n5. **Combine 7 and 1**: Let's try to combine 7 and 1 first.\n   - 7 + 1 = 8, and then we need to use 8 and 12 to get 3, which is not straightforward.\n   - 7 - 1 = 6, and then we need to use 8 and 12 to get 4, which is not straightforward.\n   - 7 * 1 = 7, and then we need to use 8 and 12 to get 17, which is not straightforward.\n   - 7 / 1 = 7, and then we need to use 8 and 12 to get 17, which is not straightforward.\n\n6. **Combine 8 and 1**: Let's try to combine 8 and 1 first.\n   - 8 + 1 = 9, and then we need to use 7 and 12 to get 15, which is not straightforward.\n   - 8 - 1 = 7, and then we need to use 7 and 12 to get 17, which is not straightforward.\n   - 8 * 1 = 8, and then we need to use 7 and 12 to get 16, which is not straightforward.\n   - 8 / 1 = 8, and then we need to use 7 and 12 to get 16, which is not straightforward.\n\n### Step 3: Try a different approach\nLet's try to use division and multiplication together.\n\n1. **Divide 12 by (8 - 7)**: 8 - 7 = 1, so 12 / 1 = 12. Then we need to use 1 to get 24, which is not straightforward.\n\n2. **Multiply 7 by (12 - 8)**: 12 - 8 = 4, so 7 * 4 = 28. Then we need to use 1 to get 24, which is not straightforward.\n\n3. **Multiply 8 by (7 - 1)**: 7 - 1 = 6, so 8 * 6 = 48. Then we need to use 12 to get 24, which is not straightforward.\n\n4. **Divide 8 by (12 - 7)**: 12 - 7 = 5, so 8 / 5 = 1.6. Then we need to use 1 to get 24, which is not straightforward.\n\n### Step 4: Combine operations\nLet's try combining multiple operations.\n\n1. **Multiply 12 by (8 / (7 - 1))**: 7 - 1 = 6, so 8 / 6 \u2248 1.333, and 12 * 1.333 \u2248 16, which is not 24.\n\n2. **Multiply 7 by (12 - (8 / 1))**: 8 / 1 = 8, so 12 - 8 = 4, and 7 * 4 = 28, which is not 24.\n\n3. **Multiply (12 - 8) by (7 - 1)**: 12 - 8 = 4, and 7 - 1 = 6, so 4 * 6 = 24.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the expression: (12 - 8) * (7 - 1) = 4 * 6 = 24.\n\nThis expression uses all the numbers 1, 7, 8, and 12 exactly once, and the result is exactly 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 - 8) * (7 - 1) = 24}",

We need to use these to get to 24.\n\n### Step 4: Use the remaining numbers\nLet's try multiplying the remaining 11s:\n11 * 11 = 121\n\nNow we have 121 and 1. If we divide 121 by 1, we still get 121, which is not helpful.\n\n### Step 5: Try a different approach\nLet's try adding two of the 11s:\n11 + 11 = 22\n\nNow we have 22, 11, and 12 left. If we add 22 and 12, we get 34, which is too high. If we subtract 12 from 22, we get 10, which is too low.\n\n### Step 6: Try using division\nLet's try dividing one of the 11s by another:\n11 / 11 = 1\n\nNow we have 11, 12, and 1 left. If we multiply 12 by 1, we get 12, and then add 11 to get 23, which is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 7: Combine operations\nLet's try combining operations in a different way. First, subtract one 11 from 12:\n12 - 11 = 1\n\nNow, multiply the remaining 11s:\n11 * 11 = 121\n\nFinally, divide 121 by 1:\n121 / 1 = 121\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24.\n\n### Step 8: Try using parentheses\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:\n(12 - (11 / 11)) * 11\n\nFirst, calculate 11 / 11 = 1\nThen, 12 - 1 = 11\nFinally, 11 * 11 = 121\n\nThis still doesn't give us 24.\n\n### Step 9: Try a different combination\nLet's try adding all three 11s:\n11 + 11 + 11 = 33\n\nNow, subtract 12 from 33:\n33 - 12 = 21\n\nThis is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 10: Try multiplying and adding\nLet's try multiplying two of the 11s and then adding the third:\n11 * 11 = 121\n121 + 11 = 132\n\nNow, subtract 12:\n132 - 12 = 120\n\nThis is too high.\n\n### Step 11: Try dividing and multiplying\nLet's try dividing one 11 by another:\n11 / 11 = 1\n\nNow, multiply by the third 11:\n1 * 11 = 11\n\nFinally, add 12:\n11 + 12 = 23\n\nThis is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 12: Try a different approach with parentheses\nLet's try:\n(11 + 11) * (12 - 11)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 + 11 = 22\nThen, 12 - 11 = 1\nFinally, 22 * 1 = 22\n\nThis is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 13: Try combining all operations\nLet's try:\n(11 * 11) / (12 - 11)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 * 11 = 121\nThen, 12 - 11 = 1\nFinally, 121 / 1 = 121\n\nThis is too high.\n\n### Step 14: Try using all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try:\n(11 + 11) + (12 - 11)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 + 11 = 22\nThen, 12 - 11 = 1\nFinally, 22 + 1 = 23\n\nThis is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 15: Try a different combination with multiplication\nLet's try:\n(11 * 12) / (11 + 11)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 * 12 = 132\nThen, 11 + 11 = 22\nFinally, 132 / 22 = 6\n\nThis is too low.\n\n### Step 16: Try using subtraction and division\nLet's try:\n(12 - (11 / 11)) * 11\n\nFirst, calculate 11 / 11 = 1\nThen, 12 - 1 = 11\nFinally, 11 * 11 = 121\n\nThis is too high.\n\n### Step 17: Try using all four numbers in a different way\nLet's try:\n(11 + 11) * (12 / 11)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 + 11 = 22\nThen, 12 / 11 \u2248 1.0909\nFinally, 22 * 1.0909 \u2248 24\n\nThis is approximately 24, but let's check the exact value:\n22 * (12 / 11) = 22 * (12 / 11) = 22 * 1.0909 \u2248 24\n\nThis is a valid solution.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(11 + 11) * (12 / 11) = 24}",

We can use them in a way that simplifies the problem. For example:\n- Subtract one 12 from the other: 12 - 12 = 0. This doesn't seem helpful.\n- Add them: 12 + 12 = 24. Now we need to incorporate 4 and 10.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate 4 and 10\nIf we add 12 + 12 = 24, we still need to use 4 and 10. However, 24 is already our target, so we need to find a way to use 4 and 10 without changing the result.\n\nOne way to do this is to use 4 and 10 in a way that results in 1, so that multiplying or dividing by 1 doesn't change the value. For example:\n- 10 - 4 = 6, which doesn't help.\n- 10 / 4 = 2.5, which also doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, we can use 4 and 10 in a way that cancels out their effect. For example:\n- (12 + 12) * (10 - 10) = 24 * 0 = 0, which is not helpful.\n- (12 + 12) / (10 - 10) = 24 / 0, which is undefined.\n\n### Step 4: Try a different approach\nInstead of adding the two 12s, let's try multiplying them:\n- 12 * 12 = 144. Now we need to use 4 and 10 to reduce 144 to 24.\n\nWe can divide 144 by 6 to get 24, so we need to use 4 and 10 to make 6:\n- 10 - 4 = 6.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n(12 * 12) / (10 - 4) = 144 / 6 = 24.\n\n### Step 5: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the equation:\n(12 * 12) / (10 - 4) = 144 / 6 = 24.\n\nThis uses all four numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 * 12) / (10 - 4) = 24}",

Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Using addition and multiplication:**\n   - \\( 3 + 5 + 8 + 8 = 24 \\)\n     - This uses all the numbers, but the result is 24. However, this is too straightforward and doesn't involve any operations other than addition.

This doesn't work.\n\n5. **Using parentheses to change precedence:**\n   - \\( 8 / (8 / (5 - 3)) = 8 / (8 / 2) = 8 / 4 = 2 \\).

To fix this, we can incorporate the 3 into the expression:\n\n\\[\n(8 - (5 - 3)) * 8 = (8 - 2) * 8 = 6 * 8 = 48\n\\]\n\nThis result is too large. Let's try another approach:\n\n\\[\n(8 / (5 - 3)) * 8 = (8 / 2) * 8 = 4 * 8 = 32\n\\]\n\nStill not 24.

Finally, let's try:\n\n\\[\n(8 * 3) - (8 / 5) = 24 - 1.6 = 22.4\n\\]\n\nNot 24.

Since 1 + 1 = 2, we can use this result in further calculations.\n- Next, consider the numbers 10 and 13. We can subtract 10 from 13 to get 3 (13 - 10 = 3).\n- Now, multiply the result of the two 1s (2) by the result of 13 - 10 (3): 2 * 3 = 6. This is too small.\n- Alternatively, divide 13 by 10 to get 1.3, but this doesn't seem helpful.\n- Another approach is to add 10 and 13 to get 23, but we still need to incorporate the two 1s.\n\n### Step 3: Try a different approach\n- Multiply 10 and 1 to get 10 (10 * 1 = 10).\n- Add the other 1 to 13 to get 14 (13 + 1 = 14).\n- Now, subtract the two results: 14 - 10 = 4.

This is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 5: Use parentheses to change precedence\n- Subtract 1 from 13 to get 12 (13 - 1 = 12).\n- Multiply 10 by the other 1 to get 10 (10 * 1 = 10).\n- Add the two results: 12 + 10 = 22.

This is too large.\n- Alternatively, subtract 13 from 20 to get 7.

Let's try another approach:\n- Multiply 10 and 1 to get 10 (10 * 1 = 10).\n- Add 13 and the other 1 to get 14 (13 + 1 = 14).\n- Add the two results: 10 + 14 = 24.\n\nThis works! We have used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(10 * 1) + (13 + 1) = 24}",

Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Attempt 1: Multiply 6 and 4**\n   - 6 * 4 = 24, but we still need to use 8 and 9. This doesn't work because we can't incorporate 8 and 9 without changing the result.\n\n2. **Attempt 2: Multiply 8 and 3**\n   - 8 * 3 = 24, but we don't have a 3. We can try to create a 3 using the remaining numbers (4, 6, 9). For example:\n     - 9 - 6 = 3, so 8 * (9 - 6) = 24. However, we still need to use the 4. This doesn't work.\n\n3. **Attempt 3: Use division**\n   - Let's try dividing 8 by 4: 8 / 4 = 2. Now we have 2, 6, and 9 left. Can we combine these to get 24?\n     - 6 * 9 = 54, and 54 / 2 = 27. This doesn't work.\n\n4. **Attempt 4: Combine addition and multiplication**\n   - Let's try adding 6 and 9: 6 + 9 = 15. Now we have 4 and 8 left. Can we combine these to get 24?\n     - 8 * 4 = 32, and 32 - 15 = 17. This doesn't work.\n\n5. **Attempt 5: Use parentheses to change precedence**\n   - Let's try (9 - 6) = 3, then multiply by 8: 8 * 3 = 24. Now we need to incorporate the 4. We can divide 24 by 4: 24 / 4 = 6. This doesn't work.\n\n6. **Attempt 6: Combine all operations**\n   - Let's try (9 - (8 / 4)) * 6:\n     - 8 / 4 = 2\n     - 9 - 2 = 7\n     - 7 * 6 = 42.

This doesn't work.\n\n8. **Attempt 8: Use division and multiplication**\n   - Let's try (6 / (9 - 8)) * 4:\n     - 9 - 8 = 1\n     - 6 / 1 = 6\n     - 6 * 4 = 24. This works!\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\nThe expression (6 / (9 - 8)) * 4 uses all the numbers 4, 6, 8, and 9 exactly once. Let's calculate it step by step:\n1. 9 - 8 = 1\n2. 6 / 1 = 6\n3. 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThe result is exactly 24, and all the rules are followed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(6 / (9 - 8)) * 4}",

We need to combine them using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to get 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for multiplication opportunities\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication is likely to be involved. Let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24.\n\n- 4 * 7 = 28\n- 4 * 9 = 36\n- 4 * 12 = 48\n- 7 * 9 = 63\n- 7 * 12 = 84\n- 9 * 12 = 108\n\nNone of these products are 24, but 4 * 7 = 28 is close.

        "output": "Let's solve the problem step by step using the numbers 2, 8, 8, and 13.\n\n### Step 1: Identify possible operations\nWe need to use all four numbers (2, 8, 8, 13) exactly once with the operations +, -, *, / to reach 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore combinations\n- First, notice that 13 is the largest number. We can try to subtract or divide it with other numbers.\n- Let\u2019s try subtracting 13 from one of the 8s:  \n  \\( 8 - 13 = -5 \\)  \n  This doesn\u2019t seem helpful immediately.\n\n- Next, let\u2019s try multiplying 13 with 2:  \n  \\( 13 * 2 = 26 \\)  \n  Now we have 26, 8, and 8 left. We can subtract one of the 8s:  \n  \\( 26 - 8 = 18 \\)  \n  This doesn\u2019t give us 24.\n\n- Let\u2019s try dividing 13 by 2:  \n  \\( 13 / 2 = 6.5 \\)  \n  Now we have 6.5, 8, and 8 left. We can multiply 6.5 by one of the 8s:  \n  \\( 6.5 * 8 = 52 \\)  \n  This is too large.\n\n### Step 3: Try a different approach\nLet\u2019s consider using both 8s together. For example, adding them:  \n\\( 8 + 8 = 16 \\)  \nNow we have 16, 2, and 13 left. We can subtract 2 from 13:  \n\\( 13 - 2 = 11 \\)  \nNow multiply 16 by 11:  \n\\( 16 * 11 = 176 \\)  \nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 4: Combine operations with parentheses\nLet\u2019s try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:  \n\\( (13 - 8) = 5 \\)  \nNow we have 5, 8, and 2 left. We can multiply 5 by 8:  \n\\( 5 * 8 = 40 \\)  \nNow subtract 2:  \n\\( 40 - 2 = 38 \\)  \nThis is still not 24.\n\n### Step 5: Try another combination\nLet\u2019s try multiplying 8 by 2:  \n\\( 8 * 2 = 16 \\)  \nNow we have 16, 8, and 13 left. We can subtract 8 from 13:  \n\\( 13 - 8 = 5 \\)  \nNow multiply 16 by 5:  \n\\( 16 * 5 = 80 \\)  \nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 6: Final approach\nLet\u2019s try dividing 8 by 2:  \n\\( 8 / 2 = 4 \\)  \nNow we have 4, 8, and 13 left. We can add 8 and 13:  \n\\( 8 + 13 = 21 \\)  \nNow multiply 4 by 21:  \n\\( 4 * 21 = 84 \\)  \nThis is still not 24.\n\n### Step 7: Correct solution\nAfter trying various combinations, here\u2019s the correct solution:  \n\\( (13 - (8 / 8)) * 2 \\)  \nFirst, divide 8 by 8:  \n\\( 8 / 8 = 1 \\)  \nThen subtract 1 from 13:  \n\\( 13 - 1 = 12 \\)  \nFinally, multiply 12 by 2:  \n\\( 12 * 2 = 24 \\)\n\n\\boxed{(13 - (8 / 8)) * 2}",

One approach is to use division or multiplication to reduce the numbers to a manageable size.\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the 12s\nLet's start by combining two of the 12s:\n- 12 + 12 = 24\n- 12 - 12 = 0\n- 12 * 12 = 144\n- 12 / 12 = 1\n\nNow, we have the results 24, 0, 144, and 1. We still need to use the remaining 12 and 1.\n\n### Step 4: Incorporate the remaining numbers\nLet's consider the result 24 from 12 + 12. We still have 12 and 1 left. If we subtract 1 from 12, we get 11, and then add 24 to 11, which gives 35, which is not 24.\n\nAlternatively, if we divide 12 by 1, we get 12, and then add 24 to 12, which gives 36, which is also not 24.\n\nLet's try another approach.\n\n### Step 5: Use multiplication and division\nConsider multiplying two 12s:\n- 12 * 12 = 144\n\nNow, we have 144, 12, and 1 left. If we divide 144 by 12, we get 12, and then multiply by 1, which gives 12, which is not 24.\n\nAlternatively, if we divide 144 by (12 / 1), we get 144 / 12 = 12, which is still not 24.\n\n### Step 6: Try a different combination\nLet's try using the 1 and one of the 12s first:\n- 12 / 1 = 12\n\nNow, we have 12, 12, and 12 left.

Since we have two 1s and two 8s, we need to find a way to use all of them.\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the 8s\nLet's consider multiplying the two 8s:\n8 * 8 = 64\n\nNow we have 64, and we need to use the two 1s to reduce this to 24. Let's try subtracting the sum of the two 1s:\n64 - (1 + 1) = 64 - 2 = 62\n\nThis is too high. Let's try dividing instead:\n64 / (1 + 1) = 64 / 2 = 32\n\nStill too high. Let's try subtracting one 1 and dividing by the other:\n(64 - 1) / 1 = 63 / 1 = 63\n\nThis is also too high. It seems that multiplying the two 8s directly doesn't lead us to 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try combining the 1s\nLet's consider adding the two 1s:\n1 + 1 = 2\n\nNow we have 2, and we need to use the two 8s to reach 24. Let's try multiplying:\n2 * 8 * 8 = 128\n\nThis is too high. Let's try dividing:\n(8 * 8) / 2 = 64 / 2 = 32\n\nStill too high. Let's try subtracting:\n(8 * 8) - 2 = 64 - 2 = 62\n\nThis is also too high. It seems that adding the two 1s directly doesn't lead us to 24.\n\n### Step 5: Try using division with the 8s\nLet's consider dividing one 8 by the other:\n8 / 8 = 1\n\nNow we have 1, and we need to use the two 1s to reach 24. Let's try adding:\n1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nThis is too low. Let's try multiplying:\n1 * 1 * 1 = 1\n\nStill too low.

For example, let's use one 8 and one 1:\n8 - 1 = 7\n\nNow we have 7, and we need to use the remaining 8 and 1 to reach 24. Let's try multiplying:\n7 * 8 = 56\n\nThis is too high. Let's try dividing:\n56 / 1 = 56\n\nStill too high. Let's try adding:\n7 + 8 + 1 = 16\n\nThis is too low. It seems that this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 7: Try using parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:\n(8 / (1 - (1 / 8)))\n\nFirst, calculate 1 / 8:\n1 / 8 = 0.125\n\nThen, subtract that from 1:\n1 - 0.125 = 0.875\n\nFinally, divide 8 by 0.875:\n8 / 0.875 = 9.142857...\n\nThis is not 24. Let's try another combination:\n(8 + 8) * (1 + 1) = 16 * 2 = 32\n\nThis is too high. Let's try:\n(8 * 8) / (1 + 1) = 64 / 2 = 32\n\nStill too high. Let's try:\n(8 * (1 + 1)) + 8 = (8 * 2) + 8 = 16 + 8 = 24\n\nThis equals 24 and uses all the numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(8 * (1 + 1)) + 8}",

Let's try different combinations:\n\n1. **Using multiplication and addition:**\n   - \\( 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\), but we still need to use 1 and 4. This doesn't work because we can't incorporate 1 and 4 without changing the result.\n\n2. **Using division and multiplication:**\n   - \\( 12 \\times (4 - 2) = 12 \\times 2 = 24 \\), but we still need to use 1. This doesn't work because we can't incorporate 1 without changing the result.\n\n3. **Using all four numbers:**\n   - \\( (12 \\times 2) \\times (4 - 1) = 24 \\times 3 = 72 \\), which is too large.\n   - \\( (12 + 4) \\times (2 + 1) = 16 \\times 3 = 48 \\), which is also too large.\n   - \\( 12 \\times (4 - (2 - 1)) = 12 \\times 3 = 36 \\), which is still too large.\n\n4. **Using division and subtraction:**\n   - \\( 12 \\times (4 - 2) = 24 \\), but we still need to use 1.

Then, \\( 20 + 2 = 22 \\), which is not 24.\n\n4. **Attempt 4:**\n   - \\( 8 \\times 5 = 40 \\), and \\( 6 - 4 = 2 \\). Then, \\( 40 / 2 = 20 \\), which is not 24.\n\n### Step 3: Refine the approach\nFrom Attempt 1, we see that creating a 3 using \\( 4 - (6 - 5) \\) and then multiplying by 8 gives us 24. Let's verify this:\n\n- \\( 6 - 5 = 1 \\)\n- \\( 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 3 = 24 \\)\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and follows the rules.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{8 * (4 - (6 - 5)) = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game with the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 10 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the numbers\nWe have the numbers 3, 7, 9, and 10. We need to combine them using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to get 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for combinations\nFirst, let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24:\n- 3 * 7 = 21\n- 3 * 9 = 27\n- 3 * 10 = 30\n- 7 * 9 = 63\n- 7 * 10 = 70\n- 9 * 10 = 90\n\nNone of these products are 24, but 3 * 7 = 21 is close. Let's see if we can adjust this to get 24.\n\n### Step 3: Adjust the product\nWe have 3 * 7 = 21. We need to add 3 to get 24. However, we still have the numbers 9 and 10 left to use.\n\n### Step 4: Use the remaining numbers\nLet's see if we can use 9 and 10 to get 3:\n- 10 - 9 = 1\n- 9 - 10 = -1\n- 10 / 9 \u2248 1.111\n- 9 / 10 = 0.9\n\nNone of these give us 3, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 5: Try a different approach\nLet's try using division. For example:\n- 10 / (9 - 7) = 10 / 2 = 5\nNow, we have 5 and 3 left. Let's see if we can combine them to get 24:\n- 5 * 3 = 15\n- 5 + 3 = 8\n- 5 - 3 = 2\n- 5 / 3 \u2248 1.666\n\nNone of these give us 24.\n\n### Step 6: Combine multiplication and addition\nLet's try multiplying 9 and 3:\n- 9 * 3 = 27\nNow, we have 27, 7, and 10 left.

Let's see if we can combine them to get 24:\n- 3 * 3 * 9 = 81\n- 3 + 3 + 9 = 15\n- 3 * 3 + 9 = 18\n- 3 * (3 + 9) = 36\n\nNone of these give us 24.\n\n### Step 8: Try a different combination\nLet's try multiplying 10 and 3:\n- 10 * 3 = 30\nNow, we have 30, 7, and 9 left. Let's see if we can adjust this to get 24:\n- 30 - 9 = 21\n- 30 - 7 = 23\n- 30 / 9 \u2248 3.333\n- 30 / 7 \u2248 4.285\n\nNone of these give us 24.\n\n### Step 9: Combine addition and multiplication\nLet's try adding 10 and 7:\n- 10 + 7 = 17\nNow, we have 17, 3, and 9 left. Let's see if we can combine them to get 24:\n- 17 + 3 + 9 = 29\n- 17 * 3 = 51\n- 17 * 9 = 153\n- 17 - 3 = 14\n- 17 - 9 = 8\n\nNone of these give us 24.\n\n### Step 10: Final approach\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a different way:\n- (10 - (9 - 7)) * 3 = (10 - 2) * 3 = 8 * 3 = 24\n\nThis gives us exactly 24, and we have used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(10 - (9 - 7)) * 3}",

Since 13 is the largest number, it might be useful to subtract or divide it with other numbers to reduce its size.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining 13 and 9\nSubtract 9 from 13:\n13 - 9 = 4\n\nNow we have the numbers 1, 2, and 4 left. Can we combine these to get 24?\n\nMultiply 4 and 2:\n4 * 2 = 8\n\nNow we have 1 and 8 left. Adding them:\n8 + 1 = 9\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try combining 13 and 2\nMultiply 13 and 2:\n13 * 2 = 26\n\nNow we have the numbers 1 and 9 left. Subtract 1 from 9:\n9 - 1 = 8\n\nNow subtract 8 from 26:\n26 - 8 = 18\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Try combining 9 and 1\nMultiply 9 and 1:\n9 * 1 = 9\n\nNow we have the numbers 2 and 13 left. Add them:\n2 + 13 = 15\n\nNow multiply 9 and 15:\n9 * 15 = 135\n\nThis is too large.

Let's try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Try combining all four numbers\nLet's try using all four numbers in one expression.

Multiply them:\n2 * 9 = 18\n\nNow add 13 and 18:\n13 + 18 = 31\n\nThis doesn't give us 24. Let's try another approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 10: Try combining 13, 9, and 2\nMultiply 13 and 2:\n13 * 2 = 26\n\nNow subtract 9:\n26 - 9 = 17\n\nNow add 1:\n17 + 1 = 18\n\nThis doesn't give us 24.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 1, 3, 10, and 10 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by looking for ways to combine these numbers. Since 10 is the largest number, it might be useful to multiply or divide it with other numbers.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try multiplying 10 and 3\nMultiply 10 and 3 to get 30. Now we have 30, 10, and 1 left. We need to use these numbers to reduce 30 to 24.\n\nSubtract 10 from 30 to get 20, but we still have 1 left. Adding 1 gives 21, which is not 24.\n\nAlternatively, subtract 1 from 30 to get 29, then subtract 10 to get 19, which is not 24.\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try dividing 10 by 1\nDivide 10 by 1 to get 10. Now we have 10, 10, and 3 left. We need to combine these to get 24.\n\nMultiply 10 and 3 to get 30, then subtract 10 to get 20, which is not 24.\n\nAlternatively, add 10 and 10 to get 20, then add 3 to get 23, which is not 24.\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Combine 10 and 10\nAdd 10 and 10 to get 20.

The goal is to combine these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nFirst, consider using multiplication or division since these operations can significantly change the value of the numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Try combining two numbers\nLet's try multiplying two of the 9s:\n9 * 9 = 81\n\nNow, we have 81, 9, and 12 left. We need to use these numbers to get 24.\n\n### Step 4: Use the remaining numbers\nLet's subtract 12 from 81:\n81 - 12 = 69\n\nNow, we have 69 and 9 left. We need to use these numbers to get 24.\n\n### Step 5: Use the last number\nLet's divide 69 by 9:\n69 / 9 = 7.666...\n\nThis does not give us 24, so this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 6: Try a different approach\nLet's try using division first. Divide 12 by 9:\n12 / 9 = 1.333...\n\nNow, we have 9, 9, and 1.333... left. We need to use these numbers to get 24.\n\n### Step 7: Multiply the remaining numbers\nMultiply 9 by 9:\n9 * 9 = 81\n\nNow, we have 81 and 1.333... left. We need to use these numbers to get 24.\n\n### Step 8: Use the last number\nDivide 81 by 1.333...:\n81 / 1.333... = 60.75\n\nThis does not give us 24, so this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 9: Try another approach\nLet's try adding two of the 9s:\n9 + 9 = 18\n\nNow, we have 18, 9, and 12 left.

We need to use these numbers to get 24.\n\n### Step 20: Use the last number\nDivide 108 by 1:\n108 / 1 = 108\n\nThis does not give us 24, so this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 21: Try using parentheses\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:\n(12 - (9 / 9)) * 9\n\nFirst, calculate 9 / 9:\n9 / 9 = 1\n\nThen, subtract 1 from 12:\n12 - 1 = 11\n\nFinally, multiply 11 by 9:\n11 * 9 = 99\n\nThis does not give us 24, so this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 22: Try another combination with parentheses\nLet's try:\n(9 + 9) * (12 / 9)\n\nFirst, calculate 9 + 9:\n9 + 9 = 18\n\nThen, calculate 12 / 9:\n12 / 9 = 1.333...\n\nFinally, multiply 18 by 1.333...:\n18 * 1.333... = 24\n\nThis gives us 24, and we have used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(9 + 9) * (12 / 9) = 24}",

The goal is to combine these numbers using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to get 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for combinations involving multiplication or division\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, it's likely that multiplication or division will be involved. Let's consider multiplying the largest number, 10, with another number.\n\n### Step 3: Combine 10 and 3\nIf we multiply 10 and 3, we get 30. Now we need to use the remaining numbers, 1 and 3, to adjust 30 down to 24.\n\n### Step 4: Use subtraction\nSubtract 3 from 30 to get 27. Now we have used 10, 3, and 3, but we still need to use the number 1.\n\n### Step 5: Adjust with the remaining number\nSubtract 1 from 27 to get 26. This is not 24, so this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 6: Try a different approach\nLet's try dividing 10 by something. If we divide 10 by (3 - 1), we get 10 / 2 = 5. Now we have used 10, 3, and 1, and we have the remaining 3.\n\n### Step 7: Multiply the result by the remaining number\nMultiply 5 by 3 to get 15. This is not 24, so this path doesn't work either.\n\n### Step 8: Consider using addition first\nAdd 1 and 3 to get 4. Now we have used 1 and 3, and we have the remaining 3 and 10.\n\n### Step 9: Multiply the result by another number\nMultiply 4 by 3 to get 12. Now we have used 1, 3, and 3, and we have the remaining 10.\n\n### Step 10: Add the remaining number\nAdd 10 to 12 to get 22. This is not 24, so this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 11: Try combining 3 and 3\nMultiply 3 and 3 to get 9. Now we have used both 3s, and we have the remaining 1 and 10.\n\n### Step 12: Add the remaining numbers\nAdd 1 and 10 to get 11. Now multiply 9 by 11 to get 99. This is not 24, so this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 13: Try a different combination\nSubtract 1 from 10 to get 9. Now we have used 1 and 10, and we have the remaining 3 and 3.\n\n### Step 14: Multiply the result by the remaining numbers\nMultiply 9 by 3 to get 27. Now subtract the remaining 3 to get 24.\n\n### Step 15: Verify the solution\nWe have used each number exactly once: 10, 1, 3, and 3. The operations are:\n- Subtract 1 from 10: 10 - 1 = 9\n- Multiply by 3: 9 * 3 = 27\n- Subtract 3: 27 - 3 = 24\n\nThis gives us the desired result of 24.\n\n\\boxed{(10 - 1) * 3 - 3 = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 1, 2, 2, and 4. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 1, 2, 2, and 4 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways. Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Multiply the largest numbers first:**\n   - 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Now we have 8, 2, 1 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 8 * 2 = 16, then 16 * 1 = 16 (too small)\n   - 8 + 2 = 10, then 10 * 1 = 10 (too small)\n   - 8 / 2 = 4, then 4 * 1 = 4 (too small)\n\n   This approach doesn't work.\n\n2. **Use division to create larger numbers:**\n   - 4 / 2 = 2\n   - Now we have 2, 2, 1 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 2 * 2 = 4, then 4 * 1 = 4 (too small)\n   - 2 + 2 = 4, then 4 * 1 = 4 (too small)\n\n   This approach also doesn't work.\n\n3. **Combine addition and multiplication:**\n   - 2 + 2 = 4\n   - Now we have 4, 4, 1 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 4 * 4 = 16, then 16 * 1 = 16 (too small)\n   - 4 + 4 = 8, then 8 * 1 = 8 (too small)\n\n   This approach doesn't work either.\n\n4. **Use parentheses to change the order of operations:**\n   - (4 + 1) = 5\n   - Now we have 5, 2, 2 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 5 * 2 = 10, then 10 * 2 = 20 (too small)\n   - 5 + 2 = 7, then 7 * 2 = 14 (too small)\n\n   This approach doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try a different strategy\nLet's try multiplying two numbers and then adding or subtracting the result of another operation.\n\n1. Multiply 4 and 2:\n   - 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Now we have 8, 2, 1 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 8 * 2 = 16, then 16 * 1 = 16 (too small)\n   - 8 + 2 = 10, then 10 * 1 = 10 (too small)\n\n   This doesn't work.\n\n2. Multiply 2 and 2:\n   - 2 * 2 = 4\n   - Now we have 4, 4, 1 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 4 * 4 = 16, then 16 * 1 = 16 (too small)\n   - 4 + 4 = 8, then 8 * 1 = 8 (too small)\n\n   This doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use division creatively\nLet's try dividing one number by another and then multiplying the result.\n\n1. Divide 4 by 1:\n   - 4 / 1 = 4\n   - Now we have 4, 2, 2 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 4 * 2 = 8, then 8 * 2 = 16 (too small)\n   - 4 + 2 = 6, then 6 * 2 = 12 (too small)\n\n   This doesn't work.\n\n2. Divide 2 by 1:\n   - 2 / 1 = 2\n   - Now we have 2, 4, 2 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 2 * 4 = 8, then 8 * 2 = 16 (too small)\n   - 2 + 4 = 6, then 6 * 2 = 12 (too small)\n\n   This doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Combine all operations\nLet's try combining addition, multiplication, and division in one expression.\n\n1. Start with 4 and 2:\n   - 4 * 2 = 8\n   - Now we have 8, 2, 1 left. How can we combine these to get 24?\n   - 8 * (2 + 1) = 8 * 3 = 24\n\n   This works! Here's the full expression:\n   - 4 * 2 * (2 + 1) = 24\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{4 * 2 * (2 + 1) = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the problem step by step using the numbers 4, 5, 5, and 5.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 4, 5, 5, and 5 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe can start by trying to combine the numbers in different ways. Let's consider using multiplication and division since they can significantly change the value.\n\n### Step 3: Try multiplying two numbers\nLet's multiply 4 and 5:\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nNow we have 20, 5, and 5 left. We need to use these three numbers to reach 24.\n\n### Step 4: Combine the remaining numbers\nLet's add the two 5s:\n5 + 5 = 10\n\nNow we have 20 and 10. Adding them together:\n20 + 10 = 30\n\nThis is too high. Let's try subtracting:\n20 - 10 = 10\n\nThis is too low. Let's try multiplying:\n20 * 10 = 200\n\nThis is way too high. Let's try dividing:\n20 / 10 = 2\n\nThis is too low. So, this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 5: Try a different approach\nLet's try dividing first. Divide 5 by 5:\n5 / 5 = 1\n\nNow we have 4, 5, and 1 left. Let's multiply 4 and 5:\n4 * 5 = 20\n\nNow we have 20 and 1. Adding them together:\n20 + 1 = 21\n\nThis is too low. Let's try multiplying:\n20 * 1 = 20\n\nStill too low. Let's try subtracting:\n20 - 1 = 19\n\nToo low. Let's try dividing:\n20 / 1 = 20\n\nStill too low. So, this path doesn't work either.\n\n### Step 6: Try using parentheses\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:\n(5 + 5) * (5 - 4) = 10 * 1 = 10\n\nThis is too low.\n\n### Step 7: Try another combination\nLet's try multiplying 5 and 5:\n5 * 5 = 25\n\nNow we have 25, 4, and 5 left. Let's subtract 4 from 25:\n25 - 4 = 21\n\nNow we have 21 and 5. Adding them together:\n21 + 5 = 26\n\nThis is too high. Let's try subtracting:\n21 - 5 = 16\n\nToo low. Let's try multiplying:\n21 * 5 = 105\n\nToo high. Let's try dividing:\n21 / 5 = 4.2\n\nToo low. So, this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 8: Try a different combination\nLet's try adding 5 and 5:\n5 + 5 = 10\n\nNow we have 10, 4, and 5 left. Let's multiply 10 and 4:\n10 * 4 = 40\n\nNow we have 40 and 5. Subtracting 5 from 40:\n40 - 5 = 35\n\nToo high. Let's try dividing:\n40 / 5 = 8\n\nToo low. Let's try adding:\n40 + 5 = 45\n\nToo high. Let's try multiplying:\n40 * 5 = 200\n\nToo high. So, this path doesn't work.\n\n### Step 9: Try combining all four numbers in one expression\nLet's try combining all four numbers in one expression using parentheses. For example:\n5 * (5 - (5 / 4)) = 5 * (5 - 1.25) = 5 * 3.75 = 18.75\n\nThis is too low.\n\n### Step 10: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n(5 + 5) * (5 - 4) = 10 * 1 = 10\n\nToo low.\n\n### Step 11: Try a different approach\nLet's try:\n5 * 5 - (5 + 4) = 25 - 9 = 16\n\nToo low.\n\n### Step 12: Try using division in a different way\nLet's try:\n(5 + 5 + 5) * 4 = 15 * 4 = 60\n\nToo high.\n\n### Step 13: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n5 * (5 - (4 / 5)) = 5 * (5 - 0.8) = 5 * 4.2 = 21\n\nToo low.\n\n### Step 14: Try a different combination\nLet's try:\n(5 * 5) - (5 / 4) = 25 - 1.25 = 23.75\n\nClose, but not 24.\n\n### Step 15: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n(5 + 5) * (5 / 4) = 10 * 1.25 = 12.5\n\nToo low.\n\n### Step 16: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n5 * (5 - (5 / 4)) = 5 * (5 - 1.25) = 5 * 3.75 = 18.75\n\nToo low.\n\n### Step 17: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n(5 * 5) - (5 - 4) = 25 - 1 = 24\n\nThis equals 24 and uses all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(5 * 5) - (5 - 4) = 24}",

Here\u2019s a new attempt:\n\n1. Divide one of the 10s by 5:\n   - \\( 10 / 5 = 2 \\)\n\n2. Multiply the result by the other 10:\n   - \\( 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\)\n\n3. Add the remaining 3:\n   - \\( 20 + 3 = 23 \\) (Too low)\n\nThis is close but not quite 24. Let\u2019s adjust the steps:\n\n1. Divide one of the 10s by 5:\n   - \\( 10 / 5 = 2 \\)\n\n2.

Multiply 10 and 3:\n   - \\( 10 \\times 3 = 30 \\)\n\n2. Subtract one of the 10s:\n   - \\( 30 - 10 = 20 \\)\n\n3. Add 5:\n   - \\( 20 + 5 = 25 \\) (Still not 24)\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Correct solution\nAfter careful consideration, here\u2019s the correct solution:\n\n1.

Here are some observations:\n1. 12 is a large number, so it might be useful to multiply or divide it with another number.\n2. The two 9s could be combined in some way, such as adding, subtracting, or dividing.\n3. 4 is a smaller number, so it might be useful for multiplication or division.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining 12 and 4\nLet\u2019s try multiplying 12 and 4:\n12 * 4 = 48. This is too large, so we need to reduce it. Perhaps we can divide by one of the 9s:\n48 / 9 \u2248 5.333, which is not 24. This doesn\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try combining the two 9s\nLet\u2019s subtract one 9 from the other:\n9 - 9 = 0. This doesn\u2019t seem helpful.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s add them:\n9 + 9 = 18. This could be useful.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Combine 18 with 12 and 4\nNow, we have 18, 12, and 4 left. Let\u2019s try adding 18 and 12:\n18 + 12 = 30. This is too large, so we need to reduce it. Perhaps we can subtract 4:\n30 - 4 = 26. This is still not 24.\n\nAlternatively, let\u2019s subtract 12 from 18:\n18 - 12 = 6. Now, we can multiply by 4:\n6 * 4 = 24.

We can use them in a way that simplifies the problem.\n- Consider dividing one 12 by the other: \\( 12 / 12 = 1 \\). This reduces the problem to using 2, 4, and 1 to make 24.\n- Now, we need to combine 2, 4, and 1 to get 24. One way to do this is to multiply them together: \\( 2 * 4 * 1 = 8 \\), which is not 24.\n- Alternatively, we can use addition and multiplication: \\( (2 + 4) * 1 = 6 \\), which is still not 24.\n- Let's try a different approach. Instead of dividing the two 12s, we can subtract them: \\( 12 - 12 = 0 \\). This reduces the problem to using 2, 4, and 0 to make 24, which is not possible.\n- Another idea is to multiply the two 12s: \\( 12 * 12 = 144 \\). Now, we need to use 2 and 4 to reduce 144 to 24. We can divide 144 by 6 (which is \\( 2 + 4 \\)): \\( 144 / 6 = 24 \\).\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the final equation:\n\\[\n(12 * 12) / (2 + 4) = 144 / 6 = 24\n\\]\nThis equation uses all four numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 * 12) / (2 + 4) = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 1, 4, 4, and 7. We need to use each number exactly once and combine them using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to get 24. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the numbers\nWe have the numbers 1, 4, 4, and 7. Since there are two 4s, we need to use both of them exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for combinations involving multiplication\nMultiplication is often useful for reaching larger numbers like 24. Let's see if we can multiply some of the numbers:\n\n- \\( 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\), which is close to 24.\n- \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\), which is also a useful intermediate result.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate the remaining numbers\nWe need to use the number 1 in the equation. Let's see how we can adjust the intermediate results to reach 24:\n\n1. Start with \\( 4 \\times 7 = 28 \\). To reduce 28 to 24, we can subtract 4: \\( 28 - 4 = 24 \\). However, this only uses the numbers 4, 7, and 4, leaving out the number 1. This is invalid because we must use all four numbers.\n\n2. Start with \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\). To reach 24, we can add 7 and 1: \\( 16 + 7 + 1 = 24 \\). This uses all four numbers, but it involves two additions, which may not be the most efficient solution.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to combine the numbers more effectively:\n\n1. \\( (7 - 1) = 6 \\). Now multiply this by one of the 4s: \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\). However, this only uses the numbers 7, 1, and 4, leaving out the second 4. This is invalid.\n\n2. \\( (7 - (1 / 4)) \\). First, divide 1 by 4: \\( 1 / 4 = 0.25 \\). Then subtract this from 7: \\( 7 - 0.25 = 6.75 \\). Now multiply by the other 4: \\( 6.75 \\times 4 = 27 \\). This is not equal to 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Combine all four numbers in a single equation\nLet's try combining all four numbers in one equation:\n\n1. \\( (7 - 1) \\times (4 - 4) = 6 \\times 0 = 0 \\). This is not equal to 24.\n\n2. \\( (7 \\times 4) - (4 \\times 1) = 28 - 4 = 24 \\). This uses all four numbers exactly once and gives the correct result.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(7 * 4) - (4 * 1) = 24}",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 3, 4, 10, and 10 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by looking for ways to combine these numbers. Since we have two 10s, we can consider using them together in operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the two 10s\nIf we subtract the two 10s, we get 10 - 10 = 0, which doesn't seem helpful. If we add them, we get 10 + 10 = 20, which is closer to 24. Let's see if we can use this result.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use the result of 10 + 10\nNow we have 20, 3, and 4 left. We need to combine these to reach 24. One way is to add 3 and 4 to get 7, and then add that to 20: 20 + 7 = 27, which is too high. Alternatively, we can multiply 3 and 4 to get 12, and then add that to 20: 20 + 12 = 32, which is also too high.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Try using division\nLet's try dividing one of the numbers. For example, divide 10 by 10 to get 1. Now we have 3, 4, and 1 left. We can multiply 3 and 4 to get 12, and then multiply by 1: 12 * 1 = 12, which is too low.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Combine multiplication and addition\nLet's try multiplying 3 and 4 to get 12, and then add one of the 10s: 12 + 10 = 22, which is close but not 24. If we add the other 10, we get 22 + 10 = 32, which is too high.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Use parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try grouping the numbers differently. For example, (10 - 4) = 6, and then multiply by 3: 6 * 3 = 18, and then add the other 10: 18 + 10 = 28, which is too high.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Try a different grouping\nLet's try (10 / (10 - 4)) = 10 / 6 \u2248 1.666, and then multiply by 3: 1.666 * 3 \u2248 5, and then add the other 10: 5 + 10 = 15, which is too low.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Combine all operations\nLet's try combining all operations in a different way. For example:\n- Multiply 10 and 3 to get 30.\n- Subtract 10 from 30 to get 20.\n- Add 4 to 20 to get 24.\n\nThis works! Here's the equation:\n(10 * 3) - 10 + 4 = 24.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(10 * 3) - 10 + 4 = 24}",

Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 1.333... * 8 * 9 = 96 (too high)\n- 1.333... + 8 + 9 = 18.333... (too low)\n- 9 / 1.333... + 8 = 14.75 (too low)\n- (9 + 8) * 1.333... = 22.666... (too low)\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 22: Try combining 8 and 12\nLet's see what happens when we combine 8 and 12:\n- 8 + 12 = 20\n- 12 - 8 = 4\n- 8 * 12 = 96\n- 12 / 8 = 1.5\n\nNow, we can try to use these results with the remaining numbers 9 and 9.\n\n### Step 23: Use 12 - 8 = 4\nIf we use 12 - 8 = 4, we have 4, 9, and 9 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 4 + 9 + 9 = 22 (too low)\n- 4 * 9 - 9 = 27 (too high)\n- 4 * (9 - 9) = 0 (too low)\n- (9 + 9) / 4 = 4.5 (too low)\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 24: Use 12 / 8 = 1.5\nIf we use 12 / 8 = 1.5, we have 1.5, 9, and 9 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 1.5 * 9 * 9 = 121.5 (too high)\n- 1.5 + 9 + 9 = 19.5 (too low)\n- 9 / 1.5 + 9 = 15 (too low)\n- (9 + 9) * 1.5 = 27 (too high)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 25: Try a more complex combination\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a more complex way. For example, let's see if we can use division and multiplication together.\n\n### Step 26: Combine 9 and 9 with division\nIf we divide one 9 by the other 9, we get 1:\n- 9 / 9 = 1\n\nNow, we have 1, 8, and 12 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 1 + 8 + 12 = 21 (too low)\n- 1 * 8 * 12 = 96 (too high)\n- 12 / (1 + 8) = 1.333... (too low)\n- (12 - 8) * 1 = 4 (too low)\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 27: Combine 8 and 12 with multiplication\nIf we multiply 8 and 12, we get 96:\n- 8 * 12 = 96\n\nNow, we have 96, 9, and 9 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 96 / 9 / 9 = 1.185... (too low)\n- 96 / (9 + 9) = 5.333... (too low)\n- (96 - 9) / 9 = 9.666... (too low)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 28: Try using subtraction and division\nLet's try using subtraction and division together. For example, let's see if we can subtract one number from another and then divide by a third number.\n\n### Step 29: Subtract 8 from 12\nIf we subtract 8 from 12, we get 4:\n- 12 - 8 = 4\n\nNow, we have 4, 9, and 9 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 4 + 9 + 9 = 22 (too low)\n- 4 * 9 - 9 = 27 (too high)\n- 4 * (9 - 9) = 0 (too low)\n- (9 + 9) / 4 = 4.5 (too low)\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 30: Try using multiplication and addition\nLet's try using multiplication and addition together. For example, let's see if we can multiply two numbers and then add the result to another number.\n\n### Step 31: Multiply 9 and 9\nIf we multiply 9 and 9, we get 81:\n- 9 * 9 = 81\n\nNow, we have 81, 8, and 12 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 81 - 8 - 12 = 61 (too high)\n- 81 / 8 / 12 = 0.84375 (too low)\n- 81 / (8 + 12) = 4.05 (too low)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 32: Try using all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try to use all four numbers in a single expression, combining them with different operations and parentheses.\n\n### Step 33: Try (12 - (9 - (9 / 8)))\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 / 8 = 1.125\n2. 9 - 1.125 = 7.875\n3. 12 - 7.875 = 4.125\n\nThis result is too low.\n\n### Step 34: Try (12 / (9 - (9 / 8)))\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 / 8 = 1.125\n2. 9 - 1.125 = 7.875\n3. 12 / 7.875 = 1.523...\n\nThis result is too low.\n\n### Step 35: Try (9 + 9) * (12 / 8)\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 + 9 = 18\n2. 12 / 8 = 1.5\n3. 18 * 1.5 = 27\n\nThis result is too high.\n\n### Step 36: Try (12 * (9 - (9 / 8)))\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 / 8 = 1.125\n2. 9 - 1.125 = 7.875\n3. 12 * 7.875 = 94.5\n\nThis result is too high.\n\n### Step 37: Try (9 * (12 - (9 / 8)))\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 / 8 = 1.125\n2. 12 - 1.125 = 10.875\n3. 9 * 10.875 = 97.875\n\nThis result is too high.\n\n### Step 38: Try (9 + (12 / (9 - 8)))\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 - 8 = 1\n2. 12 / 1 = 12\n3. 9 + 12 = 21\n\nThis result is too low.\n\n### Step 39: Try (9 * (12 - 8)) / 9\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 12 - 8 = 4\n2. 9 * 4 = 36\n3. 36 / 9 = 4\n\nThis result is too low.\n\n### Step 40: Try (9 + 9) + (12 - 8)\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 9 + 9 = 18\n2. 12 - 8 = 4\n3. 18 + 4 = 22\n\nThis result is too low.\n\n### Step 41: Try (9 * 8) / (12 - 9)\nLet's calculate this step by step:\n1. 12 - 9 = 3\n2. 9 * 8 = 72\n3. 72 / 3 = 24\n\nThis result is exactly 24!\n\n### Step 42: Verify the solution\nLet's verify that we have used all four numbers exactly once:\n- We used 9, 8, 12, and 9 exactly once.\n\nThe expression (9 * 8) / (12 - 9) equals 24, and it uses all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(9 * 8) / (12 - 9) = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 2, 6, 8, and 8. Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 2, 6, 8, and 8 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by looking for ways to combine these numbers. Since we have two 8s, we can consider using them together in operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the two 8s\nIf we subtract the two 8s:  \n8 - 8 = 0  \nThis doesn't seem helpful because 0 doesn't contribute to reaching 24.\n\nIf we add the two 8s:  \n8 + 8 = 16  \nNow we have 16, 2, and 6 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Combine 16, 2, and 6\nIf we multiply 16 and 2:  \n16 * 2 = 32  \nNow we have 32 and 6 left. Subtracting 6 from 32 gives 26, which is not 24.\n\nIf we divide 16 by 2:  \n16 / 2 = 8  \nNow we have 8 and 6 left. Adding 8 and 6 gives 14, which is not 24.\n\nIf we multiply 16 and 6:  \n16 * 6 = 96  \nNow we have 96 and 2 left. Dividing 96 by 2 gives 48, which is not 24.\n\nIf we divide 16 by 6:  \n16 / 6 \u2248 2.666  \nNow we have 2.666 and 2 left. Multiplying 2.666 and 2 gives approximately 5.333, which is not 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Try a different approach\nInstead of adding the two 8s, let's try multiplying them:  \n8 * 8 = 64  \nNow we have 64, 2, and 6 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\nIf we divide 64 by 2:  \n64 / 2 = 32  \nNow we have 32 and 6 left. Subtracting 6 from 32 gives 26, which is not 24.\n\nIf we divide 64 by 6:  \n64 / 6 \u2248 10.666  \nNow we have 10.666 and 2 left. Multiplying 10.666 and 2 gives approximately 21.333, which is not 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Use parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try combining 6 and 2 first:  \n6 / 2 = 3  \nNow we have 3, 8, and 8 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\nIf we multiply 3 and 8:  \n3 * 8 = 24  \nNow we have 24 and 8 left. Subtracting 8 from 24 gives 16, which is not 24.\n\nIf we add 3 and 8:  \n3 + 8 = 11  \nNow we have 11 and 8 left. Multiplying 11 and 8 gives 88, which is not 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Combine 8 and 8 with 6 and 2\nLet's try subtracting 2 from 6:  \n6 - 2 = 4  \nNow we have 4, 8, and 8 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\nIf we multiply 4 and 8:  \n4 * 8 = 32  \nNow we have 32 and 8 left. Subtracting 8 from 32 gives 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Verify the solution\nThe expression is:  \n(6 - 2) * 8 - 8 = 24  \nLet's verify:  \n6 - 2 = 4  \n4 * 8 = 32  \n32 - 8 = 24  \n\nThis works!\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(6 - 2) * 8 - 8 = 24}",

Each number must be used exactly once.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe have two 12s, so we can consider using them together in operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\n\n#### Option 1: Use 12 and 12 together\nIf we add 12 and 12, we get 24. However, we still need to use the numbers 1 and 2. Adding 1 and 2 gives 3, but we cannot combine 24 and 3 to get 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 2: Use 12 and 12 in multiplication\nMultiplying 12 and 12 gives 144, which is too large. We need to find a way to reduce this to 24 using the numbers 1 and 2.\n\n#### Option 3: Use 12 and 12 in division\nDividing 12 by 12 gives 1. We still need to use the numbers 1 and 2. Adding 1 and 2 gives 3, but we cannot combine 1 and 3 to get 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 4: Use 12 and 12 in subtraction\nSubtracting 12 from 12 gives 0. We still need to use the numbers 1 and 2. Adding 1 and 2 gives 3, but we cannot combine 0 and 3 to get 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 3: Try combining 12 with other numbers\nLet's try using one 12 with the other numbers.\n\n#### Option 1: Multiply 12 by 2\nMultiplying 12 by 2 gives 24. We still need to use the numbers 1 and 12. Adding 1 and 12 gives 13, but we cannot combine 24 and 13 to get 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 2: Divide 12 by 2\nDividing 12 by 2 gives 6. We still need to use the numbers 1 and 12. Adding 1 and 12 gives 13, but we cannot combine 6 and 13 to get 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 3: Subtract 2 from 12\nSubtracting 2 from 12 gives 10. We still need to use the numbers 1 and 12. Adding 1 and 12 gives 13, but we cannot combine 10 and 13 to get 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 4: Try using 1 and 2 together\nLet's try combining 1 and 2 first.\n\n#### Option 1: Add 1 and 2\nAdding 1 and 2 gives 3. We still need to use the numbers 12 and 12. Multiplying 12 and 12 gives 144, which is too large. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 2: Multiply 1 and 2\nMultiplying 1 and 2 gives 2. We still need to use the numbers 12 and 12. Multiplying 12 and 12 gives 144, which is too large. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 3: Subtract 1 from 2\nSubtracting 1 from 2 gives 1. We still need to use the numbers 12 and 12. Multiplying 12 and 12 gives 144, which is too large. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 4: Divide 2 by 1\nDividing 2 by 1 gives 2. We still need to use the numbers 12 and 12. Multiplying 12 and 12 gives 144, which is too large. This approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 5: Try combining operations\nLet's try combining multiple operations.\n\n#### Option 1: Use 12, 12, and 2\nWe can subtract 2 from one 12 to get 10, then multiply by the other 12:\n(12 - 2) * 12 = 10 * 12 = 120\nThis is too large.\n\n#### Option 2: Use 12, 12, and 1\nWe can subtract 1 from one 12 to get 11, then multiply by the other 12:\n(12 - 1) * 12 = 11 * 12 = 132\nThis is too large.\n\n#### Option 3: Use 12, 2, and 1\nWe can multiply 2 and 1 to get 2, then multiply by 12:\n2 * 1 * 12 = 24\nBut we still need to use the other 12. This approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 6: Try using division and multiplication\nLet's try using division and multiplication together.\n\n#### Option 1: Divide 12 by 1\nDividing 12 by 1 gives 12. We still need to use the numbers 2 and 12. Multiplying 12 and 2 gives 24, but we still have the other 12 left. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Option 2: Divide 12 by 2\nDividing 12 by 2 gives 6. We still need to use the numbers 1 and 12. Multiplying 6 and 12 gives 72, which is too large. This approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 7: Try using parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to combine operations in a different order.\n\n#### Option 1: (12 / (12 / 2)) * 1\nFirst, divide 12 by 2 to get 6. Then divide 12 by 6 to get 2. Finally, multiply by 1 to get 2. This is not 24.\n\n#### Option 2: (12 + 12) * (2 - 1)\nFirst, add 12 and 12 to get 24. Then subtract 1 from 2 to get 1. Finally, multiply 24 by 1 to get 24. This works!\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 + 12) * (2 - 1) = 24}",

First, multiply 2 and 3:\n\\[ 2 * 3 = 6 \\]\nNow, add the other 2:\n\\[ 6 + 2 = 8 \\]\nFinally, multiply by 12:\n\\[ 8 * 12 = 96 \\]\nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 6: Use parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. First, add the two 2s:\n\\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \\]\nNow, multiply by 3:\n\\[ 4 * 3 = 12 \\]\nFinally, multiply by 12:\n\\[ 12 * 12 = 144 \\]\nThis is also too large.\n\n### Step 7: Try a different combination\nLet's try dividing 12 by (2 + 2):\n\\[ 2 + 2 = 4 \\]\n\\[ 12 / 4 = 3 \\]\nNow, multiply by the remaining 3:\n\\[ 3 * 3 = 9 \\]\nThis gives us 9, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 8: Final approach\nLet's try multiplying 12 by 2:\n\\[ 12 * 2 = 24 \\]\nNow, we need to incorporate the remaining 2 and 3 without changing the result. We can do this by multiplying by 1:\n\\[ 2 / 2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ 3 / 3 = 1 \\]\nBut this doesn't help. Instead, let's try:\n\\[ 12 * 2 = 24 \\]\n\\[ 3 - 2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ 24 * 1 = 24 \\]\nThis works! We have used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 * 2) * (3 - 2) = 24}",

Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Attempt 1:**\n   - Multiply 6 and 4: \\(6 * 4 = 24\\)\n   - But we still have 6 and 9 left unused. This doesn't work.\n\n2. **Attempt 2:**\n   - Add 6 and 6: \\(6 + 6 = 12\\)\n   - Multiply by 2: \\(12 * 2 = 24\\)\n   - But we don't have a 2 in the given numbers.

This doesn't work.\n\n4. **Attempt 4:**\n   - Divide 6 by 6: \\(6 / 6 = 1\\)\n   - Add 9: \\(1 + 9 = 10\\)\n   - Multiply by 4: \\(10 * 4 = 40\\)\n   - This is too large.

Let's try:\n\n1. **Attempt 5:**\n   - Subtract 4 from 9: \\(9 - 4 = 5\\)\n   - Multiply by 6: \\(5 * 6 = 30\\)\n   - Subtract the other 6: \\(30 - 6 = 24\\)\n   - This works!

Since we have two 11s, we can consider operations involving them.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try subtracting 11 from 11\nSubtracting one 11 from the other gives 0:\n\\[ 11 - 11 = 0 \\]\nThis doesn't seem helpful because multiplying or adding 0 to other numbers won't help us reach 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try adding 11 and 11\nAdding the two 11s gives 22:\n\\[ 11 + 11 = 22 \\]\nNow we need to use the remaining numbers (2 and 4) to reach 24.

Then subtract: \\( 11 - 5.5 = 5.5 \\). Finally, multiply by 4: \\( 5.5 * 4 = 22 \\). Wait, this doesn't work.\n\nLet's try another approach:\n\\[ (11 + 11) + (4 - 2) = 24 \\]\nFirst, calculate \\( 11 + 11 = 22 \\) and \\( 4 - 2 = 2 \\). Then add: \\( 22 + 2 = 24 \\).

Let's consider multiplying the largest numbers first, as they are more likely to get us closer to 24.\n\n#### Attempt 1:\nMultiply 11 and 5:\n11 * 5 = 55\n\nNow, we need to use 1 and 7 to reduce 55 to 24. However, 55 - 7 - 1 = 47, which is too high. Alternatively, 55 / (7 + 1) = 55 / 8 = 6.875, which is too low.

Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n11 + 5 + 6 = 22, which is too low.\n11 * 5 - 6 = 55 - 6 = 49, which is too high.\n11 * (5 - 6) = 11 * (-1) = -11, which is too low.\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 7:\nLet's try another combination:\n(11 - 7) = 4\n\nNow, we have 5, 1, and 4 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n5 * 4 * 1 = 20, which is too low.\n5 * (4 + 1) = 5 * 5 = 25, which is close but not 24.\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 8:\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a single expression:\n(11 - 5) * (7 - 1) = 6 * 6 = 36, which is too high.\n\n#### Attempt 9:\nLet's try a different combination:\n11 * (7 - (5 + 1)) = 11 * (7 - 6) = 11 * 1 = 11, which is too low.\n\n#### Attempt 10:\nLet's try another combination:\n(11 + 1) * (7 - 5) = 12 * 2 = 24\n\nThis combination works!

Let's consider multiplying the largest numbers first, as they are more likely to get us closer to 24.\n\n#### Attempt 1:\nMultiply 12 and 2:\n12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow we have 24, but we still need to use 5 and 9. However, adding or subtracting 5 and 9 would change the result, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 2:\nMultiply 9 and 5:\n9 * 5 = 45\n\nThis is too large, so we need to reduce it. Let's try dividing by 2:\n45 / 2 = 22.5\n\nNow we have 22.5, but we still need to use 12. Adding 12 would give us 34.5, which is too large. Subtracting 12 would give us 10.5, which is too small. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 3:\nMultiply 12 and 5:\n12 * 5 = 60\n\nThis is too large, so we need to reduce it. Let's try dividing by 2:\n60 / 2 = 30\n\nNow we have 30, but we still need to use 9. Subtracting 9 would give us 21, which is too small. Adding 9 would give us 39, which is too large. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 4:\nMultiply 9 and 2:\n9 * 2 = 18\n\nNow we have 18, but we still need to use 5 and 12. Adding 5 and 12 would give us 35, which is too large. Subtracting 5 from 12 would give us 7, and adding that to 18 would give us 25, which is close but not 24. This approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 5:\nLet's try combining addition and multiplication. For example:\n(12 - 5) = 7\nNow multiply by 2:\n7 * 2 = 14\nNow add 9:\n14 + 9 = 23\n\nThis is close but not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 6:\nLet's try a different combination:\n(12 - 9) = 3\nNow multiply by 5:\n3 * 5 = 15\nNow add 2:\n15 + 2 = 17\n\nThis is too small.\n\n#### Attempt 7:\nLet's try using division:\n12 / 2 = 6\nNow multiply by 5:\n6 * 5 = 30\nNow subtract 9:\n30 - 9 = 21\n\nThis is too small.\n\n#### Attempt 8:\nLet's try another combination:\n(9 - 5) = 4\nNow multiply by 12:\n4 * 12 = 48\nNow divide by 2:\n48 / 2 = 24\n\nThis works!

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 4, 10, 10, and 12 step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 4, 10, 10, and 12 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by looking for combinations of these numbers that could result in 24. Here are some observations:\n1. 12 is a large number, so it might be useful to subtract or divide it by another number.\n2. The two 10s can be combined in various ways, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing.\n3. 4 is a smaller number, so it might be useful for multiplication or division.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the numbers\nLet\u2019s try combining the numbers in different ways:\n\n#### Attempt 1:\n- Subtract 12 from one of the 10s: \\(10 - 12 = -2\\)\n- Multiply the result by the other 10: \\(-2 \\times 10 = -20\\)\n- Add 4: \\(-20 + 4 = -16\\) (Not 24)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work.\n\n#### Attempt 2:\n- Add the two 10s: \\(10 + 10 = 20\\)\n- Add 4: \\(20 + 4 = 24\\)\n- Now we have 24, but we haven\u2019t used 12. This is invalid because we must use all four numbers.\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work.\n\n#### Attempt 3:\n- Divide 12 by 4: \\(12 / 4 = 3\\)\n- Multiply the result by one of the 10s: \\(3 \\times 10 = 30\\)\n- Subtract the other 10: \\(30 - 10 = 20\\) (Not 24)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work.\n\n#### Attempt 4:\n- Subtract 4 from 12: \\(12 - 4 = 8\\)\n- Multiply the result by one of the 10s: \\(8 \\times 10 = 80\\)\n- Divide by the other 10: \\(80 / 10 = 8\\) (Not 24)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work.\n\n#### Attempt 5:\n- Add 10 and 12: \\(10 + 12 = 22\\)\n- Add 4: \\(22 + 4 = 26\\)\n- Subtract 10: \\(26 - 10 = 16\\) (Not 24)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work.\n\n#### Attempt 6:\n- Multiply 10 and 12: \\(10 \\times 12 = 120\\)\n- Divide by 10: \\(120 / 10 = 12\\)\n- Add 4: \\(12 + 4 = 16\\) (Not 24)\n\nThis doesn\u2019t work.\n\n#### Attempt 7:\n- Subtract 10 from 12: \\(12 - 10 = 2\\)\n- Multiply by 10: \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n- Add 4: \\(20 + 4 = 24\\)\n\nThis works! We\u2019ve used all four numbers exactly once: 12, 10, 10, and 4.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify the solution\nThe expression is:\n\\[\n(12 - 10) \\times 10 + 4 = 24\n\\]\nLet\u2019s verify:\n1. \\(12 - 10 = 2\\)\n2. \\(2 \\times 10 = 20\\)\n3. \\(20 + 4 = 24\\)\n\nThe result is exactly 24, and all four numbers are used exactly once. This is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 - 10) * 10 + 4 = 24}",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 7, 10, 12, and 12 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Look for combinations\nFirst, observe that 12 is repeated, so we need to use both 12s. Let\u2019s try to combine the numbers in different ways.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try multiplying the 12s\nIf we multiply the two 12s, we get:\n12 * 12 = 144\nThis is too large, so we need to reduce it using the other numbers (7 and 10).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use division to reduce the result\nDivide 144 by one of the other numbers:\n144 / 7 \u2248 20.57 (not 24)\n144 / 10 = 14.4 (not 24)\nThis approach doesn\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Try combining 12 and 10\nSubtract 10 from 12:\n12 - 10 = 2\nNow, multiply this result by the other 12:\n2 * 12 = 24\nBut we still need to use the 7. This approach doesn\u2019t work because we haven\u2019t used 7.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Incorporate 7 into the equation\nLet\u2019s try subtracting 7 from 10:\n10 - 7 = 3\nNow, multiply this result by one of the 12s:\n3 * 12 = 36\nBut we still need to use the other 12. This approach doesn\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Use division with 12 and 7\nDivide 12 by 7:\n12 / 7 \u2248 1.714\nNow, multiply this result by the other 12:\n1.714 * 12 \u2248 20.57 (not 24)\nThis approach doesn\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Combine all four numbers\nLet\u2019s try combining all four numbers in a single expression:\n(12 - (12 / (10 - 7))) = 12 - (12 / 3) = 12 - 4 = 8 (not 24)\nThis approach doesn\u2019t work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Try a different combination\nMultiply 10 and 7:\n10 * 7 = 70\nNow, subtract one of the 12s:\n70 - 12 = 58\nBut we still need to use the other 12.

Let\u2019s try another approach:\n(12 / (12 - 10)) * 7 = (12 / 2) * 7 = 6 * 7 = 42 (not 24)\nStill not correct. Let\u2019s try:\n(10 - (12 / 12)) * 7 = (10 - 1) * 7 = 9 * 7 = 63 (not 24)\nHmm, this isn\u2019t working. Let\u2019s try:\n(12 + 12) - (10 + 7) = 24 - 17 = 7 (not 24)\nNot correct. Let\u2019s try:\n(12 * (10 - 7)) - 12 = (12 * 3) - 12 = 36 - 12 = 24\nThis works! We\u2019ve used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 * (10 - 7)) - 12 = 24}",

Let's see:\n- 12 + 11 + 11 = 34 (too high)\n- 12 * 11 / 11 = 12 (too low)\n- 12 + (11 - 11) = 12 (too low)\n- 12 * (11 / 11) = 12 (too low)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 10: Try combining 8 * 4 = 32 with the two 11s\nIf we multiply 8 * 4 = 32, we need to use the two 11s to reach 24. Let's see:\n- 32 - 11 - 11 = 10 (too low)\n- 32 / (11 - 11) = undefined (invalid)\n- 32 - (11 + 11) = 10 (too low)\n- 32 / 11 + 11 = 13.909 (too low)\n\nThis approach doesn't work.\n\n### Step 11: Try combining 8 / 4 = 2 with the two 11s\nIf we divide 8 / 4 = 2, we need to use the two 11s to reach 24. Let's see:\n- 2 + 11 + 11 = 24 (this works!)\n\n### Step 12: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the solution:\n- 8 / 4 = 2\n- 2 + 11 + 11 = 24\n\nThis uses all four numbers exactly once and follows the rules.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(8 / 4) + 11 + 11 = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 1, 8, 8, 8 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 1, 8, 8, 8 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe have three 8s and one 1. Let's think about how we can combine these numbers.\n\n#### Option 1: Use division\nWe can try dividing one of the 8s by 1, but this doesn't seem helpful because 8 / 1 = 8, which doesn't change the value.\n\n#### Option 2: Use multiplication\nWe can try multiplying the 8s together. For example, 8 * 8 = 64, but this is too large. We need to find a way to reduce this value to 24.\n\n#### Option 3: Use subtraction\nWe can try subtracting the 1 from one of the 8s. For example, 8 - 1 = 7. Now we have 7, 8, 8 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the numbers\nLet's try combining the numbers step by step.\n\n1. Start with 8 - 1 = 7.\n2. Now we have 7, 8, 8 left.\n3. Multiply 7 and 8: 7 * 8 = 56.\n4. Now we have 56 and 8 left.\n5. Divide 56 by 8: 56 / 8 = 7.\n\nThis gives us 7, which is not 24. So this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 4: Try a different approach\nLet's try using all three 8s in a different way.\n\n1. Multiply two of the 8s: 8 * 8 = 64.\n2. Now we have 64, 8, and 1 left.\n3. Divide 64 by 8: 64 / 8 = 8.\n4. Now we have 8 and 1 left.\n5. Multiply 8 and 1: 8 * 1 = 8.\n\nThis gives us 8, which is not 24. So this combination doesn't work either.\n\n### Step 5: Use parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations.\n\n1. Start with 8 / (8 - 1) = 8 / 7 \u2248 1.142.\n2. Now we have 1.142, 8, and 8 left.\n3. Multiply 1.142 and 8: 1.142 * 8 \u2248 9.142.\n4. Now we have 9.142 and 8 left.\n5. Multiply 9.142 and 8: 9.142 * 8 \u2248 73.142.\n\nThis gives us approximately 73.142, which is not 24. So this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 6: Try another approach\nLet's try using the 1 in a different way.\n\n1. Start with 8 * (8 - 1) = 8 * 7 = 56.\n2. Now we have 56 and 8 left.\n3. Divide 56 by 8: 56 / 8 = 7.\n\nThis gives us 7, which is not 24. So this combination doesn't work.\n\n### Step 7: Final attempt\nLet's try combining all four numbers in a different way.\n\n1. Start with 8 + 8 = 16.\n2. Now we have 16, 8, and 1 left.\n3. Multiply 16 and 1: 16 * 1 = 16.\n4. Now we have 16 and 8 left.\n5. Add 16 and 8: 16 + 8 = 24.\n\nThis gives us 24, and we have used all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(8 + 8) * 1 + 8 = 24}",

Let's consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Multiply 8 and 3**:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   Now we need to incorporate 1 and 9. However, if we use 8 and 3 to get 24, we still have 1 and 9 left, and we cannot use them without altering the result. So this approach doesn't work.\n\n2. **Use 9 and 1**:  \n   \\( 9 - 1 = 8 \\)  \n   Now we have 8, 3, and 8. We can use these to get 24:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\)  \n   However, this uses the number 8 twice, which violates the rule of using each number exactly once. So this approach is invalid.\n\n3. **Use 9 and 3**:  \n   \\( 9 / 3 = 3 \\)  \n   Now we have 1, 8, and 3. We can try to combine these:  \n   \\( 8 * 3 = 24 \\), but again, we have the number 1 left unused. This approach doesn't work.\n\n4. **Use 8 and 1**:  \n   \\( 8 + 1 = 9 \\)  \n   Now we have 9, 3, and 9. We can try to combine these:  \n   \\( 9 * 3 = 27 \\), but this doesn't give us 24, and we have an extra 9. This approach is invalid.\n\n5. **Combine all four numbers**:  \n   Let's try to use all four numbers in a single expression. For example:  \n   \\( (9 - 1) * (8 - 3) = 8 * 5 = 40 \\)  \n   This is too large. Let's try another combination:  \n   \\( (9 + 3) * (8 - 1) = 12 * 7 = 84 \\)  \n   This is also too large. Let's try a different approach:  \n   \\( 9 * (8 - (3 + 1)) = 9 * 4 = 36 \\)  \n   Still too large. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * 3) - (8 * 1) = 27 - 8 = 19 \\)  \n   This is too small. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 + 8) * (3 - 1) = 17 * 2 = 34 \\)  \n   Still too large. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * 8) / (3 + 1) = 72 / 4 = 18 \\)  \n   This is too small. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * 3) + (8 / 1) = 27 + 8 = 35 \\)  \n   Still too large. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 + 3) + (8 + 1) = 12 + 9 = 21 \\)  \n   This is too small. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * 8) - (3 * 1) = 72 - 3 = 69 \\)  \n   This is too large. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 + 8 + 3 + 1) = 21 \\)  \n   This is too small. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * 3) - (8 - 1) = 27 - 7 = 20 \\)  \n   This is too small. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * (8 - 3)) - 1 = 9 * 5 - 1 = 45 - 1 = 44 \\)  \n   This is too large. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 + 1) * (8 - 3) = 10 * 5 = 50 \\)  \n   This is too large. Let's try:  \n   \\( (9 * 8) / (3 * 1) = 72 / 3 = 24 \\)  \n   This works! We have used all four numbers exactly once, and the result is 24.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the solution:  \n\\( (9 * 8) / (3 * 1) = 72 / 3 = 24 \\)  \nThis is correct.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(9 * 8) / (3 * 1)}",

Since 8 is the largest number, it\u2019s a good candidate for multiplication or division.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try multiplying 8 and 3\nIf we can create 3 using the remaining numbers (1, 2, and 8), we can multiply it by 8 to get 24. Let\u2019s see how to make 3:\n- \\( 2 + 1 = 3 \\)\n\nNow, multiply this result by 8:\n- \\( 8 * (2 + 1) = 24 \\)\n\nHowever, this only uses the numbers 1, 2, and 8, leaving the second 8 unused.

For example:\n- \\( 8 + 8 = 16 \\)\n\nNow, we need to use the remaining numbers (1 and 2) to reach 24 from 16.

Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Attempt 1:**\n   - \\( 9 - 5 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n2. **Attempt 2:**\n   - \\( 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n   - \\( 9 - 4 = 5 \\)\n   - \\( 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n3. **Attempt 3:**\n   - \\( 9 \\times 4 = 36 \\)\n   - \\( 8 - 5 = 3 \\)\n   - \\( 36 / 3 = 12 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n4. **Attempt 4:**\n   - \\( 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\)\n   - \\( 9 - 8 = 1 \\)\n   - \\( 20 + 1 = 21 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try using parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try grouping the numbers differently:\n\n1. **Attempt 5:**\n   - \\( (9 - 5) = 4 \\)\n   - \\( (8 - 4) = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 4 \\times 4 = 16 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n2. **Attempt 6:**\n   - \\( (9 - 8) = 1 \\)\n   - \\( (5 \\times 4) = 20 \\)\n   - \\( 20 + 1 = 21 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n3. **Attempt 7:**\n   - \\( (9 \\times 5) = 45 \\)\n   - \\( (8 - 4) = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 45 / 4 = 11.25 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Combine operations creatively\nLet's try combining multiplication and division in a different way:\n\n1. **Attempt 8:**\n   - \\( 9 \\times (8 - 5) = 9 \\times 3 = 27 \\)\n   - \\( 27 - 4 = 23 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n2. **Attempt 9:**\n   - \\( (9 - 5) = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n   - \\( 32 - 4 = 28 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n3. **Attempt 10:**\n   - \\( (9 \\times 4) = 36 \\)\n   - \\( (8 - 5) = 3 \\)\n   - \\( 36 / 3 = 12 \\)\n   - This does not equal 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find the correct combination\nAfter several attempts, we find the correct combination:\n\n1. **Correct Solution:**\n   - \\( 9 - 5 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n   - \\( 32 - 8 = 24 \\)\n\nWait, this uses the number 8 twice, which violates the rules. Let's try again.\n\n2. **Correct Solution:**\n   - \\( 9 - 5 = 4 \\)\n   - \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n   - \\( 32 - 8 = 24 \\)\n\nThis still uses 8 twice. Let's think differently.\n\n3. **Correct Solution:**\n   - \\( 9 - (8 - 5) = 9 - 3 = 6 \\)\n   - \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\)\n\nThis uses all the numbers exactly once and equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(9 - (8 - 5)) * 4 = 24}",

We need to use each number exactly once with the allowed operations to reach 24.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the numbers\nWe have two 1s, a 5, and a 7. Since 1 is a small number, we might need to use it in a way that amplifies the other numbers.\n\n### Step 2: Try combining the 1s\nOne approach is to combine the two 1s first.

Let's try combining them:\n- \\(12 \\times (1 + 1) = 24\\)\n\nThis works! We have used all four numbers exactly once and reached 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(5 + 7) * (1 + 1) = 24}",

Multiplying them:\n63 * 1 = 63\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 9: Try dividing 9 by 7\n9 / 7 \u2248 1.2857\n\nNow, we have 1.2857 and 1 (from 13 / 13). Multiplying them:\n1.2857 * 1 \u2248 1.2857\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 10: Try a different approach\nLet's try using one of the 13s in a different way. For example, let's subtract 7 from 13:\n13 - 7 = 6\n\nNow, we have 6, 9, and the other 13. Let's try multiplying 6 and 9:\n6 * 9 = 54\n\nNow, we have 54 and 13. Subtracting 13 from 54:\n54 - 13 = 41\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 11: Try dividing 13 by 7\n13 / 7 \u2248 1.8571\n\nNow, we have 1.8571, 9, and the other 13.

Subtracting 13 from 54:\n54 - 13 = 41\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 20: Try using parentheses\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations. For example:\n(13 - 7) * (13 - 9) = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nThis works! We have used all four numbers exactly once, and the result is 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(13 - 7) * (13 - 9) = 24}",

Let's try to create a 3 using the remaining numbers (1, 6, 10).\n\n5. **Create 3 using 10, 6, and 1:**\n   - 10 - 6 = 4\n   - 4 - 1 = 3 (This gives us 3.)\n\n6. **Combine the results:**\n   - 8 * (10 - 6 - 1) = 8 * 3 = 24\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{8 * (10 - 6 - 1) = 24}",

Here's the equation:\n(6 + 9) * 2 - 6 = 24\n\n---\n\n### Step 15: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the equation step by step:\n1. 6 + 9 = 15\n2. 15 * 2 = 30\n3. 30 - 6 = 24\n\nThe equation equals 24, and all numbers (2, 6, 6, 9) are used exactly once. This is a valid solution.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(6 + 9) * 2 - 6 = 24}",

This approach doesn't work because we can't use 7 and 10 without altering the result.\n\n2. **Add 10 and 7**:  \n   \\(10 + 7 = 17\\)  \n   Now we have 17, 6, and 4 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\n3. **Multiply 6 and 4**:  \n   \\(6 * 4 = 24\\)  \n   Now we have 24 and 17. We can subtract 17 from 24:  \n   \\(24 - 17 = 7\\)  \n   This doesn't give us 24.\n\n4. **Subtract 7 from 10**:  \n   \\(10 - 7 = 3\\)  \n   Now we have 3, 6, and 4 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\n5. **Multiply 6 and 4**:  \n   \\(6 * 4 = 24\\)  \n   Now we have 24 and 3. We can divide 24 by 3:  \n   \\(24 / 3 = 8\\)  \n   This doesn't give us 24.\n\n6. **Add 6 and 4**:  \n   \\(6 + 4 = 10\\)  \n   Now we have 10, 10, and 7 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\n7. **Multiply 10 and 10**:  \n   \\(10 * 10 = 100\\)  \n   Now we have 100 and 7. We can subtract 7 from 100:  \n   \\(100 - 7 = 93\\)  \n   This doesn't give us 24.\n\n8. **Divide 10 by 10**:  \n   \\(10 / 10 = 1\\)  \n   Now we have 1, 6, and 7 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\n9. **Multiply 6 and 7**:  \n   \\(6 * 7 = 42\\)  \n   Now we have 42 and 1. We can subtract 1 from 42:  \n   \\(42 - 1 = 41\\)  \n   This doesn't give us 24.\n\n10. **Subtract 6 from 10**:  \n    \\(10 - 6 = 4\\)  \n    Now we have 4, 7, and 4 left. We can try to combine these to reach 24.\n\n11. **Multiply 4 and 7**:  \n    \\(4 * 7 = 28\\)  \n    Now we have 28 and 4. We can subtract 4 from 28:  \n    \\(28 - 4 = 24\\)  \n    This gives us 24, and we have used all the numbers exactly once.\n\n### Step 3: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the solution step by step:\n\n1. \\(10 - 6 = 4\\)  \n2. \\(4 * 7 = 28\\)  \n3. \\(28 - 4 = 24\\)\n\nAll the numbers 4, 6, 7, and 10 are used exactly once, and the final result is 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(10 - 6) * 7 - 4 = 24}",

We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that results in 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for multiplication opportunities\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication is likely to be involved. Let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24.\n\n- 2 * 5 = 10\n- 2 * 12 = 24\n- 2 * 13 = 26\n- 5 * 12 = 60\n- 5 * 13 = 65\n- 12 * 13 = 156\n\nFrom these, 2 * 12 = 24 is interesting, but we still need to use 5 and 13. If we use 2 * 12 = 24, we need to incorporate 5 and 13 in a way that doesn't change the result. This seems challenging.\n\n### Step 3: Consider using division\nLet's see if division can help us adjust the result.\n\n- 13 / 5 = 2.6\n- 12 / 2 = 6\n- 5 / 2 = 2.5\n\n### Step 4: Combine operations\nLet's try combining multiplication and division.\n\n- (13 - 5) = 8\n- 8 * (12 / 2) = 8 * 6 = 48 (too high)\n  \nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach.\n\n- (12 / (13 - 5)) = 12 / 8 = 1.5\n- 1.5 * 2 = 3 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 5: Try using addition and multiplication\nLet's see if we can add some numbers first.\n\n- 5 + 13 = 18\n- 18 + 2 = 20\n- 20 + 12 = 32 (too high)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- 12 + 13 = 25\n- 25 - 5 = 20\n- 20 + 2 = 22 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 6: Try using subtraction and multiplication\nLet's see if subtraction can help.\n\n- 13 - 5 = 8\n- 8 * 2 = 16\n- 16 + 12 = 28 (too high)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- 12 - 2 = 10\n- 10 * (13 - 5) = 10 * 8 = 80 (too high)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 7: Try using all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try to combine all four numbers in a single expression.\n\n- (13 - 5) * (12 / 2) = 8 * 6 = 48 (too high)\n  \nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- (12 + 13) - (5 + 2) = 25 - 7 = 18 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 8: Try using division and multiplication together\nLet's see if we can use division and multiplication together to adjust the result.\n\n- (12 / (13 - 5)) * 2 = (12 / 8) * 2 = 1.5 * 2 = 3 (too low)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- (13 - (12 / 2)) * 5 = (13 - 6) * 5 = 7 * 5 = 35 (too high)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 9: Try using a combination of all operations\nLet's try to use a combination of all operations.\n\n- (13 - 5) * (12 / 2) = 8 * 6 = 48 (too high)\n  \nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- (12 + 13) - (5 * 2) = 25 - 10 = 15 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 10: Re-examining the numbers\nLet's try to think differently. Maybe we can use 13 and 5 in a way that reduces the result.\n\n- 13 - 5 = 8\n- 12 / 2 = 6\n- 8 * 6 = 48 (too high)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another approach.\n\n- (13 - (12 / 2)) * 5 = (13 - 6) * 5 = 7 * 5 = 35 (too high)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 11: Try using division first\nLet's see if we can use division first.\n\n- 12 / 2 = 6\n- 13 - 5 = 8\n- 6 * 8 = 48 (too high)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- 13 / (12 / 2) = 13 / 6 \u2248 2.1667\n- 2.1667 * 5 \u2248 10.8333 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 12: Try using subtraction and division\nLet's see if we can use subtraction and division together.\n\n- (13 - 5) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4\n- 4 * 12 = 48 (too high)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- (12 - (13 - 5)) * 2 = (12 - 8) * 2 = 4 * 2 = 8 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 13: Try using all four numbers in a different order\nLet's try to use all four numbers in a different order.\n\n- (13 - (12 / 2)) * 5 = (13 - 6) * 5 = 7 * 5 = 35 (too high)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- (12 + 13) - (5 * 2) = 25 - 10 = 15 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 14: Try using multiplication and subtraction\nLet's see if we can use multiplication and subtraction together.\n\n- 12 * 2 = 24\n- 13 - 5 = 8\n- 24 - 8 = 16 (too low)\n\nThis doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n- 13 * 2 = 26\n- 26 - (12 + 5) = 26 - 17 = 9 (too low)\n\nThis also doesn't work.\n\n### Step 15: Try using division and addition\nLet's see if we can use division and addition together.\n\n- 12 / 2 = 6\n- 13 + 5 = 18\n- 6 + 18 = 24\n\nThis works! We have used all four numbers exactly once, and the result is 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 / 2) + (13 + 5)}",

The goal is to combine these numbers using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to get exactly 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for multiplication opportunities\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication is likely to be involved. Let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24.\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12\n- 3 * 5 = 15\n- 3 * 12 = 36\n- 4 * 5 = 20\n- 4 * 12 = 48\n- 5 * 12 = 60\n\nNone of these products are exactly 24, but some are close. Let's see if we can adjust these results using the remaining numbers.\n\n### Step 3: Combine operations\nLet's try combining multiplication with addition or subtraction.\n\n- 3 * 4 = 12, and then 12 + 5 + 12 = 29 (too high)\n- 3 * 5 = 15, and then 15 + 4 + 12 = 31 (too high)\n- 4 * 5 = 20, and then 20 + 3 + 12 = 35 (too high)\n- 5 * 12 = 60, and then 60 / 3 / 4 = 5 (too low)\n\nThese combinations don't work, so let's try using division.\n\n### Step 4: Incorporate division\nLet's see if dividing one number by another can help us reach 24.\n\n- 12 / 3 = 4, and then 4 * 5 * 4 = 80 (too high)\n- 12 / 4 = 3, and then 3 * 5 * 3 = 45 (too high)\n- 12 / 5 = 2.4, and then 2.4 * 3 * 4 = 28.8 (too high)\n\nThese attempts don't work either, so let's try combining operations in a different way.\n\n### Step 5: Use parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to group operations differently.\n\n- (12 - 5) = 7, and then 7 * 3 * 4 = 84 (too high)\n- (12 - 4) = 8, and then 8 * 3 * 5 = 120 (too high)\n- (12 - 3) = 9, and then 9 * 4 * 5 = 180 (too high)\n\nThese combinations are still too high, so let's try a different approach.\n\n### Step 6: Combine multiplication and division\nLet's try multiplying two numbers and then dividing by another.\n\n- (3 * 4) = 12, and then 12 * (12 / 5) = 28.8 (too high)\n- (3 * 5) = 15, and then 15 * (12 / 4) = 45 (too high)\n- (4 * 5) = 20, and then 20 * (12 / 3) = 80 (too high)\n\nThese attempts are still not working, so let's try a different combination.\n\n### Step 7: Final combination\nLet's try the following combination:\n\n1. Divide 12 by 3: 12 / 3 = 4\n2. Multiply the result by 5: 4 * 5 = 20\n3. Add the remaining number: 20 + 4 = 24\n\nThis combination uses all four numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 / 3) * 5 + 4}",

We need to use each of these numbers exactly once with the operations +, -, *, / to reach 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for multiplication opportunities\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication is likely to be involved. Let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24.\n\n- 4 * 6 = 24, but we still have 8 and 12 left unused.

We can multiply 4 * 6 = 24, but we still have an extra 4 left unused.

We can multiply 6 * 4 = 24, but we still have an extra 6 left unused. This doesn't work.\n\n### Step 5: Use all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try to use all four numbers in one expression:\n\n- (12 - (8 - 6)) * 4 = (12 - 2) * 4 = 10 * 4 = 40. This is too high.\n- (12 / (8 - 6)) * 4 = (12 / 2) * 4 = 6 * 4 = 24.

Since there are three 11s, we might need to combine them in a way that reduces their impact or uses them effectively.\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the 11s\nOne approach is to subtract two of the 11s:\n11 - 11 = 0\n\nNow we have 9, 11, and 0 left. However, using 0 doesn't seem helpful in reaching 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try a different approach\nLet's try multiplying two of the 11s:\n11 * 11 = 121\n\nNow we have 9, 11, and 121. This seems too large, and it's unclear how to reduce it to 24.\n\n### Step 5: Consider using division\nLet's try dividing one 11 by another:\n11 / 11 = 1\n\nNow we have 9, 11, and 1. This might be more manageable.\n\n### Step 6: Combine the remaining numbers\nNow, let's see how we can use 9, 11, and 1 to get 24.\n\nOne idea is to multiply 11 by 1:\n11 * 1 = 11\n\nNow we have 9 and 11. Adding them gives:\n9 + 11 = 20\n\nThis is close to 24 but not quite there.\n\n### Step 7: Adjust the approach\nLet's try a different combination.

Adding 9 and 11 gives:\n9 + 11 = 20\n\nThen adding 20 and 22 gives:\n20 + 22 = 42\n\nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 9: Consider using multiplication and division\nLet's try multiplying 9 and 11:\n9 * 11 = 99\n\nNow we have 11, 11, and 99. This seems too large.\n\n### Step 10: Try a different strategy\nLet's try using all four numbers in a single expression. For example:\n(11 - (11 / 11)) * 9\n\nFirst, calculate 11 / 11:\n11 / 11 = 1\n\nThen subtract:\n11 - 1 = 10\n\nFinally, multiply by 9:\n10 * 9 = 90\n\nThis is too large.\n\n### Step 11: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n(11 + 11) / (11 - 9)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 + 11:\n11 + 11 = 22\n\nThen calculate 11 - 9:\n11 - 9 = 2\n\nFinally, divide:\n22 / 2 = 11\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 12: Try a different approach\nLet's try:\n(11 * 11) / (11 + 9)\n\nFirst, calculate 11 * 11:\n11 * 11 = 121\n\nThen calculate 11 + 9:\n11 + 9 = 20\n\nFinally, divide:\n121 / 20 = 6.05\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 13: Try another combination\nLet's try:\n(11 + 11 + 11) - 9\n\nFirst, calculate 11 + 11 + 11:\n11 + 11 + 11 = 33\n\nThen subtract 9:\n33 - 9 = 24\n\nThis equals 24 and uses all four numbers exactly once.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(11 + 11 + 11) - 9 = 24}",

        "output": "Let's solve the 24 Game problem with the numbers 5, 6, 9, and 12 step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the numbers\nWe have the numbers 5, 6, 9, and 12. We need to combine them using addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/) to get exactly 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for multiplication opportunities\nSince 24 is a relatively large number, multiplication is likely to be involved. Let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24.\n\n- 6 * 5 = 30 (too high)\n- 6 * 4 = 24 (but we don't have a 4)\n- 12 * 2 = 24 (but we don't have a 2)\n\n### Step 3: Combine operations\nLet's try combining operations to reach 24.\n\n- 12 - 5 = 7\n- 9 - 6 = 3\n- Now, multiply the results: 7 * 3 = 21 (too low)\n\n### Step 4: Try different combinations\nLet's try another approach:\n\n- 12 / (9 - 5) = 12 / 4 = 3\n- Now, multiply by 6: 3 * 6 = 18 (too low)\n\n### Step 5: Use parentheses to change precedence\nLet's try using parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n- (12 - 9) = 3\n- (6 - 5) = 1\n- Now, multiply the results: 3 * 1 = 3 (too low)\n\n### Step 6: Combine all four numbers\nLet's try to use all four numbers in a single expression:\n\n- 12 - (9 - (6 / 5)) = 12 - (9 - 1.2) = 12 - 7.8 = 4.2 (too low)\n\n### Step 7: Find the correct combination\nAfter several attempts, let's try this combination:\n\n- (12 - (9 - 5)) * 6 = (12 - 4) * 6 = 8 * 6 = 48 (too high)\n\nWait, that's not correct. Let's try another approach:\n\n- (12 / (9 - 5)) * 6 = (12 / 4) * 6 = 3 * 6 = 18 (too low)\n\n### Step 8: Final solution\nAfter exploring different combinations, here's the correct way to reach 24:\n\n- (12 - (9 - 5)) * 6 = (12 - 4) * 6 = 8 * 6 = 48 (Wait, that's not 24)\n\nOops, that's incorrect. Let's try another approach:\n\n- (12 / (9 - 5)) * 6 = (12 / 4) * 6 = 3 * 6 = 18 (Still not 24)\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\n- (12 - 9) * (6 - 5) = 3 * 1 = 3 (Not 24)\n\nHmm, let's try this:\n\n- 12 * (6 / (9 - 5)) = 12 * (6 / 4) = 12 * 1.5 = 18 (Still not 24)\n\nWait, let's try this:\n\n- (12 - 6) * (9 - 5) = 6 * 4 = 24\n\nYes! This combination works.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 - 6) * (9 - 5) = 24}",

Here are some attempts:\n\n1. **Attempt 1: Multiply 8 and 3**\n   - 8 * 3 = 24\n   - Now we need to incorporate 1 and 7. However, adding or subtracting 1 and 7 will change the result, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n2. **Attempt 2: Use division**\n   - 8 / (1 - (7 / 3)) = 8 / (1 - 2.333) = 8 / (-1.333) = -6\n   - This doesn't work.\n\n3. **Attempt 3: Combine addition and multiplication**\n   - (7 + 1) * (8 - 3) = 8 * 5 = 40\n   - This is too large.\n\n4. **Attempt 4: Use subtraction and multiplication**\n   - (8 - 1) * (7 - 3) = 7 * 4 = 28\n   - This is close but not 24.\n\n5. **Attempt 5: Use division and multiplication**\n   - (8 / (1 + 3)) * 7 = (8 / 4) * 7 = 2 * 7 = 14\n   - This is too small.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try a different approach\nLet's try to use parentheses to change the order of operations:\n\n1. **Attempt 6: Combine 7 and 1 first**\n   - 7 - 1 = 6\n   - Now we have 6, 3, and 8 left.

Adding 1 and 2 gives 3, and \\(20 + 3 = 23\\), which is not 24.\n\n2. **Attempt 2: Multiply 5 and 4, then add 2 and 1**\n   - \\(5 * 4 = 20\\)\n   - \\(2 + 1 = 3\\)\n   - \\(20 + 3 = 23\\), which is not 24.\n\n3. **Attempt 3: Multiply 5 and 4, then subtract 1 and add 2**\n   - \\(5 * 4 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 - 1 = 19\\)\n   - \\(19 + 2 = 21\\), which is not 24.\n\n4. **Attempt 4: Use division**\n   - \\(5 / 1 = 5\\)\n   - \\(5 * 4 = 20\\)\n   - \\(20 + 2 = 22\\), which is not 24.\n\n5. **Attempt 5: Combine operations with parentheses**\n   - \\(5 * (4 + 1) = 5 * 5 = 25\\)\n   - \\(25 - 2 = 23\\), which is not 24.\n\n6. **Attempt 6: Use subtraction and multiplication**\n   - \\(5 - 1 = 4\\)\n   - \\(4 * 4 = 16\\)\n   - \\(16 + 2 = 18\\), which is not 24.\n\n7. **Attempt 7: Use division and multiplication**\n   - \\(4 / 2 = 2\\)\n   - \\(5 * 2 = 10\\)\n   - \\(10 + 1 = 11\\), which is not 24.\n\n8. **Attempt 8: Combine all operations**\n   - \\(5 * (4 + (2 - 1)) = 5 * (4 + 1) = 5 * 5 = 25\\), which is not 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the correct combination\nAfter trying various combinations, we find the following solution:\n\n\\[\n(5 - 1) * (4 + 2) = 4 * 6 = 24\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(5 - 1) * (4 + 2) = 24}",

Let's consider the following approach:\n\n1. **Multiply 12 and 2**: If we can create 2 using 3, 4, and 7, then multiplying by 12 would give us 24.\n   - To create 2, we can subtract 3 from 7 and then divide by 4: \\((7 - 3) / 4 = 1\\). This doesn't work.\n   - Alternatively, we can subtract 4 from 7 and then divide by 3: \\((7 - 4) / 3 = 1\\). This also doesn't work.\n\n2. **Multiply 7 and 3**: \\(7 * 3 = 21\\). We need to add or subtract something to reach 24.\n   - Adding 12 and 4: \\(21 + 12 + 4 = 37\\). This is too high.\n   - Subtracting 12 and 4: \\(21 - 12 - 4 = 5\\). This is too low.\n\n3. **Multiply 4 and 6**: If we can create 6 using 3, 7, and 12, then multiplying by 4 would give us 24.\n   - To create 6, we can subtract 7 from 12 and then add 3: \\(12 - 7 + 3 = 8\\). This doesn't work.\n   - Alternatively, we can subtract 3 from 12 and then subtract 7: \\(12 - 3 - 7 = 2\\). This also doesn't work.\n\n4. **Divide 12 by 3**: \\(12 / 3 = 4\\).

Let's try to combine the numbers to get a product close to 24.\n\n### Step 3: Combine the numbers\nFirst, multiply two of the 3s:\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, multiply the result by the remaining 3:\n9 * 3 = 27\n\nFinally, subtract the 2:\n27 - 2 = 25\n\nThis gives us 25, which is close but not 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try a different approach\nLet's try dividing one of the 3s by the 2:\n3 / 2 = 1.5\n\nNow, multiply this result by the other two 3s:\n1.5 * 3 * 3 = 13.5\n\nThis gives us 13.5, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 5: Combine addition and multiplication\nLet's add two of the 3s:\n3 + 3 = 6\n\nNow, multiply this result by the remaining 3:\n6 * 3 = 18\n\nFinally, add the 2:\n18 + 2 = 20\n\nThis gives us 20, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 6: Try using parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try multiplying the 2 and one of the 3s:\n2 * 3 = 6\n\nNow, add the other two 3s:\n3 + 3 = 6\n\nFinally, multiply the two results:\n6 * 6 = 36\n\nThis gives us 36, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 7: Explore division and subtraction\nLet's subtract one of the 3s from the 2:\n2 - 3 = -1\n\nNow, multiply this result by the other two 3s:\n-1 * 3 * 3 = -9\n\nThis gives us -9, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 8: Try a combination of all operations\nLet's try dividing one of the 3s by the 2:\n3 / 2 = 1.5\n\nNow, add the other two 3s:\n3 + 3 = 6\n\nFinally, multiply the two results:\n1.5 * 6 = 9\n\nThis gives us 9, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 9: Re-examine the previous steps\nLooking back at Step 3, we got 25, which is very close to 24. Let's see if we can adjust this to get exactly 24.\n\nInstead of subtracting 2, let's try dividing by 2:\n27 / 2 = 13.5\n\nThis gives us 13.5, which is not 24.\n\n### Step 10: Try a different combination\nLet's multiply two of the 3s:\n3 * 3 = 9\n\nNow, add the remaining 3:\n9 + 3 = 12\n\nFinally, multiply by the 2:\n12 * 2 = 24\n\nThis gives us exactly 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(3 * 3 + 3) * 2 = 24}",

Here's the step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\nWe need to use the numbers 3, 5, 13, and 13 exactly once, along with the operations +, -, *, /, and parentheses, to create an expression that equals 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Explore possible combinations\nWe start by looking for ways to combine these numbers. Since 13 is a large number, we might consider using it in a way that reduces its impact, such as subtraction or division.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining 13 and 13\nFirst, let's see what happens when we combine the two 13s:\n- 13 + 13 = 26\n- 13 - 13 = 0\n- 13 * 13 = 169\n- 13 / 13 = 1\n\nNone of these results directly help us reach 24, so we need to consider using the other numbers (3 and 5) in combination with these results.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use 13 / 13 = 1\nIf we divide 13 by 13, we get 1. Now we can use this result with the remaining numbers (3 and 5):\n- 3 + 5 + 1 = 9 (too small)\n- 3 * 5 * 1 = 15 (too small)\n- 5 - 3 + 1 = 3 (too small)\n- 5 / 3 + 1 \u2248 2.666 (too small)\n\nThis approach doesn't seem promising, so let's try something else.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Use 13 - 13 = 0\nIf we subtract 13 from 13, we get 0. Now we can use this result with the remaining numbers (3 and 5):\n- 3 + 5 + 0 = 8 (too small)\n- 3 * 5 * 0 = 0 (too small)\n- 5 - 3 + 0 = 2 (too small)\n- 5 / 3 + 0 \u2248 1.666 (too small)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try a different strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Use 13 + 13 = 26\nIf we add the two 13s, we get 26. Now we can use this result with the remaining numbers (3 and 5):\n- 26 - 5 - 3 = 18 (too small)\n- 26 / 5 - 3 \u2248 2.2 (too small)\n- 26 / (5 - 3) = 13 (too small)\n- 26 - (5 * 3) = 11 (too small)\n\nThis approach doesn't work either, so let's try something else.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Use 13 * 13 = 169\nIf we multiply the two 13s, we get 169. Now we can use this result with the remaining numbers (3 and 5):\n- 169 / 5 / 3 \u2248 11.266 (too small)\n- 169 / (5 * 3) \u2248 11.266 (too small)\n- 169 - (5 * 3) = 154 (too large)\n- 169 + (5 * 3) = 184 (too large)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work, so let's try a different strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Combine 13 and 5\nLet's try combining 13 and 5:\n- 13 + 5 = 18\n- 13 - 5 = 8\n- 13 * 5 = 65\n- 13 / 5 = 2.6\n\nNow we can use these results with the remaining numbers (3 and 13):\n- If we use 13 + 5 = 18, we can try:\n  - 18 + 3 + 13 = 34 (too large)\n  - 18 * 3 - 13 = 41 (too large)\n  - 18 / 3 + 13 = 19 (too small)\n  - 18 - 3 + 13 = 28 (too large)\n- If we use 13 - 5 = 8, we can try:\n  - 8 + 3 + 13 = 24 (this works!)\n\n---\n\n### Step 9: Verify the solution\nThe expression (13 - 5) + 3 + 13 equals 24. Let's verify:\n- 13 - 5 = 8\n- 8 + 3 = 11\n- 11 + 13 = 24\n\nThis satisfies all the rules of the game.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(13 - 5) + 3 + 13 = 24}",

We need to use each number exactly once with the basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) to reach the result of 24.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the numbers\nThe numbers are 4, 6, 8, and 10. We need to find a combination of these numbers and operations that equals 24.\n\n### Step 2: Try multiplication\nMultiplication often leads to larger numbers, so let's see if we can use it effectively:\n- \\( 4 \\times 6 = 24 \\), but this only uses two numbers. We need to incorporate 8 and 10 as well.\n\n### Step 3: Incorporate all numbers\nLet's try to use all four numbers:\n- \\( 10 - 6 = 4 \\)\n- Now we have 4, 4, and 8. This doesn't seem helpful.\n\n### Step 4: Try different combinations\nLet's try another approach:\n- \\( 8 - 4 = 4 \\)\n- Now we have 4, 6, and 10. Still not helpful.\n\n### Step 5: Use division\nLet's try using division:\n- \\( 10 / 5 = 2 \\), but we don't have a 5.\n\nWait, let's think differently:\n- \\( 6 / (10 - 8) = 6 / 2 = 3 \\)\n- Now we have 3, 4, and 8. Still not 24.\n\n### Step 6: Combine operations\nLet's try combining operations:\n- \\( (10 - 6) = 4 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n- \\( 32 - 8 = 24 \\), but this uses 8 twice.\n\nThis doesn't work because we can't use 8 twice.\n\n### Step 7: Correct combination\nLet's try a different combination:\n- \\( 10 - 6 = 4 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n- \\( 32 - 8 = 24 \\), but again, this uses 8 twice.\n\nThis approach is invalid.\n\n### Step 8: Final solution\nAfter trying various combinations, here's a valid solution:\n- \\( (10 - 6) = 4 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\)\n- \\( 32 - 8 = 24 \\), but this uses 8 twice.\n\nWait, this is incorrect. Let's try another approach:\n- \\( 10 - (8 - 6) = 10 - 2 = 8 \\)\n- \\( 8 \\times 4 = 32 \\), which is not 24.\n\nLet's try:\n- \\( 6 \\times 4 = 24 \\)\n- \\( 10 - 8 = 2 \\)\n- \\( 24 \\times 2 = 48 \\), which is not 24.\n\nWait, let's think differently:\n- \\( 10 \\times (8 - 6) = 10 \\times 2 = 20 \\)\n- \\( 20 + 4 = 24 \\)\n\nThis uses all four numbers exactly once and results in 24.\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{10 * (8 - 6) + 4 = 24}",

Since we have two 11s, we can consider using them together in some way.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining the two 11s\nIf we subtract one 11 from the other, we get 0, which doesn't seem helpful.

We can try adding 5 and 10 to 22, but 22 + 5 + 10 = 37, which is too large. Alternatively, we can try multiplying or dividing.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Use multiplication or division\nIf we multiply 5 and 10, we get 50. Then, 50 - 22 = 28, which is still not 24. If we divide 10 by 5, we get 2. Then, 22 + 2 = 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Verify the solution\nThe expression is: (11 + 11) + (10 / 5) = 22 + 2 = 24.

Let's try multiplying 12 by 2:\n\n\\[ 12 * 2 = 24 \\]\n\nNow we have used 12 and 2, but we still need to use 1 and 3. We can incorporate them by adding or subtracting them in a way that doesn't change the result.

We need to use each number exactly once with the operations +, -, *, / to reach 24.\n\n### Step 2: Look for combinations\nFirst, let's see if we can multiply two numbers to get close to 24:\n- 4 * 5 = 20\n- 4 * 10 = 40\n- 4 * 12 = 48\n- 5 * 10 = 50\n- 5 * 12 = 60\n- 10 * 12 = 120\n\nNone of these directly give us 24, but 4 * 5 = 20 is close. Let's see if we can use the remaining numbers (10 and 12) to adjust 20 to 24.\n\n### Step 3: Adjust 20 to 24\nWe have 10 and 12 left. Let's see if we can use these to adjust 20 to 24:\n- 20 + 10 = 30 (too high)\n- 20 + 12 = 32 (too high)\n- 20 - 10 = 10 (too low)\n- 20 - 12 = 8 (too low)\n- 20 * 10 = 200 (too high)\n- 20 * 12 = 240 (too high)\n- 20 / 10 = 2 (too low)\n- 20 / 12 \u2248 1.666 (too low)\n\nNone of these adjustments work directly. Let's try a different approach.\n\n### Step 4: Use division\nLet's see if we can use division to get closer to 24:\n- 12 / 4 = 3\nNow we have 3, 5, and 10 left. Let's see if we can combine these to get 24:\n- 3 * 5 = 15\n- 15 + 10 = 25 (close but not 24)\n- 3 * 10 = 30\n- 30 - 5 = 25 (close but not 24)\n- 5 * 10 = 50\n- 50 / 3 \u2248 16.666 (not 24)\n\nThis approach doesn't work either. Let's try another combination.\n\n### Step 5: Combine addition and multiplication\nLet's try adding two numbers first:\n- 10 + 12 = 22\nNow we have 4 and 5 left. Let's see if we can adjust 22 to 24:\n- 22 + 4 = 26\n- 26 - 5 = 21 (not 24)\n- 22 + 5 = 27\n- 27 - 4 = 23 (not 24)\n- 22 * 4 = 88\n- 88 / 5 = 17.6 (not 24)\n- 22 * 5 = 110\n- 110 / 4 = 27.5 (not 24)\n\nThis approach also doesn't work. Let's try another combination.\n\n### Step 6: Use subtraction\nLet's try subtracting two numbers:\n- 12 - 10 = 2\nNow we have 4 and 5 left. Let's see if we can adjust 2 to 24:\n- 2 + 4 = 6\n- 6 * 5 = 30 (not 24)\n- 2 * 4 = 8\n- 8 * 5 = 40 (not 24)\n- 2 * 5 = 10\n- 10 * 4 = 40 (not 24)\n- 5 - 4 = 1\n- 2 * 1 = 2 (not 24)\n\nThis approach doesn't work either.

Let's see if we can adjust 20 to 24:\n- 20 + 10 = 30\n- 30 - 12 = 18 (not 24)\n- 20 + 12 = 32\n- 32 - 10 = 22 (not 24)\n- 20 * 10 = 200\n- 200 / 12 \u2248 16.666 (not 24)\n- 20 * 12 = 240\n- 240 / 10 = 24\n\nThis gives us 240 / 10 = 24, but we still have the number 5 left unused.

Let's try another approach.\n\n### Step 11: Combine multiplication and addition\nLet's try multiplying two numbers and then adding the result of another operation:\n- 10 * 5 = 50\n- 12 - 4 = 8\n- 50 - 8 = 42 (not 24)\n- 12 * 5 = 60\n- 10 - 4 = 6\n- 60 / 6 = 10 (not 24)\n- 10 * 4 = 40\n- 12 - 5 = 7\n- 40 - 7 = 33 (not 24)\n- 12 * 4 = 48\n- 10 - 5 = 5\n- 48 / 5 = 9.6 (not 24)\n\nNone of these combinations work. Let's try another approach.\n\n### Step 12: Combine division and multiplication\nLet's try dividing one number by another and then multiplying the result:\n- 12 / 4 = 3\n- 10 * 5 = 50\n- 50 / 3 \u2248 16.666 (not 24)\n- 10 / 5 = 2\n- 12 * 4 = 48\n- 48 / 2 = 24\n\nThis gives us 48 / 2 = 24, and we have used all four numbers exactly once:\n- 10 / 5 = 2\n- 12 * 4 = 48\n- 48 / 2 = 24\n\n### Final Answer\n\\boxed{(12 * 4) / (10 / 5) = 24}",

Let's try another approach:\n- (12 * (7 - 4)) - 12 = (12 * 3) - 12 = 36 - 12 = 24.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 * (7 - 4)) - 12 = 24}",

Since 11 and 13 are large, we might consider using subtraction or division to reduce their values.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Try combining 11 and 13\nSubtracting 11 from 13 gives 2:\n\\[ 13 - 11 = 2 \\]\nNow we have the numbers 1, 2, and 2 left. However, we need to use all four numbers exactly once, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Try multiplying 11 and 13\nMultiplying 11 and 13 gives 143, which is too large. This doesn't seem helpful.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Try dividing 13 by 11\nDividing 13 by 11 gives approximately 1.18, which doesn't seem useful either.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Combine 1 and 2\nAdding 1 and 2 gives 3:\n\\[ 1 + 2 = 3 \\]\nNow we have the numbers 3, 11, and 13 left. We can try to combine these.\n\n---\n\n### Step 7: Multiply 3 and 11\nMultiplying 3 and 11 gives 33:\n\\[ 3 * 11 = 33 \\]\nNow we have 33 and 13 left. Subtracting 13 from 33 gives 20, which is not 24.\n\n---\n\n### Step 8: Try a different approach\nLet's try using division.

Subtract the result from 13: \\( 13 - 3.6667 \\approx 9.3333 \\)\nThis does not equal 24, so this approach is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 14: Correct solution\nHere's the correct solution:\n\\[ (13 - 1) * (11 - 2) = 24 \\]\nStep-by-step:\n1. Subtract 1 from 13: \\( 13 - 1 = 12 \\)\n2. Subtract 2 from 11: \\( 11 - 2 = 9 \\)\n3. Multiply the results: \\( 12 * 9 = 108 \\)\nThis does not equal 24, so this approach is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 15: Correct solution\nHere's the correct solution:\n\\[ (11 - (13 - (1 + 2))) = 24 \\]\nStep-by-step:\n1.

Subtract 1 from 13: \\( 13 - 1 = 12 \\)\n2. Subtract 2 from 11: \\( 11 - 2 = 9 \\)\n3. Multiply the results: \\( 12 * 9 = 108 \\)\nThis does not equal 24, so this approach is incorrect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 17: Correct solution\nHere's the correct solution:\n\\[ (11 + 13) * (2 - 1) = 24 \\]\nStep-by-step:\n1. Add 11 and 13: \\( 11 + 13 = 24 \\)\n2. Subtract 1 from 2: \\( 2 - 1 = 1 \\)\n3. Multiply the results: \\( 24 * 1 = 24 \\)\nThis equals 24 and uses all four numbers exactly once.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(11 + 13) * (2 - 1) = 24}",

Let's consider multiplying the largest numbers first, as they are more likely to get us closer to 24.\n\n#### Attempt 1:\nMultiply 12 and 2:\n12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow we have 24, but we still need to use 6 and 7. However, adding or subtracting 6 and 7 will change the result, so this approach doesn't work.\n\n#### Attempt 2:\nMultiply 6 and 7:\n6 * 7 = 42\n\nNow we have 42, which is too large. We can try to reduce it by subtracting 12 and 2:\n42 - 12 - 2 = 28\n\nThis is still not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 3:\nDivide 12 by 2:\n12 / 2 = 6\n\nNow we have 6, 6, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n6 + 6 + 7 = 19\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 4:\nMultiply 6 and 2:\n6 * 2 = 12\n\nNow we have 12, 12, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n12 + 12 + 7 = 31\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 5:\nSubtract 2 from 7:\n7 - 2 = 5\n\nNow we have 5, 6, and 12. We can try to combine these:\n5 + 6 + 12 = 23\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 6:\nMultiply 6 and 7:\n6 * 7 = 42\n\nNow subtract 12 and 2:\n42 - 12 - 2 = 28\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 7:\nDivide 12 by 6:\n12 / 6 = 2\n\nNow we have 2, 2, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n2 + 2 + 7 = 11\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 8:\nMultiply 12 and 2:\n12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow we have 24, but we still need to use 6 and 7. We can try to incorporate them in a way that doesn't change the result:\n24 + 6 - 7 = 23\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 9:\nMultiply 6 and 7:\n6 * 7 = 42\n\nNow divide by 12:\n42 / 12 = 3.5\n\nNow we have 3.5 and 2. We can try to combine these:\n3.5 + 2 = 5.5\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 10:\nMultiply 12 and 2:\n12 * 2 = 24\n\nNow we have 24, but we still need to use 6 and 7. We can try to incorporate them in a way that doesn't change the result:\n24 + 6 - 7 = 23\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 3: Try using parentheses to change the order of operations\nLet's try using parentheses to combine the numbers in a different way.\n\n#### Attempt 11:\n(12 - 6) = 6\n\nNow we have 6, 2, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n6 + 2 + 7 = 15\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 12:\n(7 - 2) = 5\n\nNow we have 5, 6, and 12. We can try to combine these:\n5 + 6 + 12 = 23\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 13:\n(12 / (7 - 2)) = 12 / 5 = 2.4\n\nNow we have 2.4 and 6. We can try to combine these:\n2.4 + 6 = 8.4\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 14:\n(6 / (12 - 7)) = 6 / 5 = 1.2\n\nNow we have 1.2 and 2. We can try to combine these:\n1.2 + 2 = 3.2\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 15:\n(12 - (7 - 2)) = 12 - 5 = 7\n\nNow we have 7 and 6. We can try to combine these:\n7 + 6 = 13\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 4: Try combining multiplication and addition\nLet's try combining multiplication and addition in a different way.\n\n#### Attempt 16:\n(6 * 2) = 12\n\nNow we have 12, 12, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n12 + 12 + 7 = 31\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 17:\n(7 * 2) = 14\n\nNow we have 14, 6, and 12. We can try to combine these:\n14 + 6 + 12 = 32\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 18:\n(12 * 2) = 24\n\nNow we have 24, 6, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n24 + 6 - 7 = 23\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 5: Try combining division and multiplication\nLet's try combining division and multiplication in a different way.\n\n#### Attempt 19:\n(12 / 2) = 6\n\nNow we have 6, 6, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n6 + 6 + 7 = 19\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 20:\n(6 / 2) = 3\n\nNow we have 3, 12, and 7. We can try to combine these:\n3 + 12 + 7 = 22\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 21:\n(12 / (6 / 2)) = 12 / 3 = 4\n\nNow we have 4 and 7. We can try to combine these:\n4 + 7 = 11\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n### Step 6: Try combining all four numbers in a single expression\nLet's try to combine all four numbers in a single expression using parentheses.\n\n#### Attempt 22:\n(12 - (7 - 2)) * 6 = (12 - 5) * 6 = 7 * 6 = 42\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 23:\n(12 / (7 - 2)) * 6 = (12 / 5) * 6 = 2.4 * 6 = 14.4\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 24:\n(6 * (7 - 2)) - 12 = (6 * 5) - 12 = 30 - 12 = 18\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 25:\n(6 + 2) * (12 - 7) = 8 * 5 = 40\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 26:\n(12 + 6) / (7 - 2) = 18 / 5 = 3.6\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 27:\n(12 * 2) - (7 + 6) = 24 - 13 = 11\n\nThis is not 24.\n\n#### Attempt 28:\n(12 * (7 - 6)) * 2 = (12 * 1) * 2 = 12 * 2 = 24\n\nThis expression uses all four numbers exactly once and equals 24.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{(12 * (7 - 6)) * 2}",
